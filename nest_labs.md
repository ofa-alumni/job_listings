##What is great about your company?

Nest ( www.nest.com). Nest, its an amazing place and one of those rare opportunities to build the next great tech company in the Valley.  Founded by Tony Fadell (father of iPod and SVP of iPod | iPhone) and funded by Kleiner Perkins & Google Ventures, we not only are one of the hottest startups, but have quickly become the icon of cool for home consciousness and in 1 short year have made a huge splash. We are truly, one of the hottest startups in the Valley



By any metric you might measure us by, we have been insanely successful – however, we are about to get bigger and badder (which services will play a huge part) as we move into our next phase of our overarching strategy – we are building out something that has never been attempted before. 



I assure you, in our services backend, that there is a true challenge ahead and our server-side stuff needs to reliably ingest a billions of pieces of data, exercise some smart machine learning and finally serve that up as a ton of API calls.  Security, reliability, scalability and availability are going to be extreme going forward.  Think - thousands of servers, millions of requests, billions of logs and petabytes of data.
