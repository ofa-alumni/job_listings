##What is great about your company?

The company's vision is the be the best place in the world for nerds to work!  I can bring my dog to work, work flex hours, eat free food, drink from our Kegerator, receive in office massages and countless other perks, but that's not what makes my job great.  What makes the Nerdery great is that people come together to solve problems, learn, teach and have fun while doing so.  We build websites and mobile apps for all types of companies and we're hiring talented developers!



Please contact me with any questions, I do the recruiting for the Chicago office (we also have locations in Minneapolis, Kansas City and remote).



Thanks!
