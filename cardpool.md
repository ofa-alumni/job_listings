##What is great about your company?

Cardpool makes it ridiculously easy to buy and sell gift cards online.  In the last 2.5 years, the company has grown from 2 guys in a living room to a company that helps thousands of customers buy and sell gift cards every day.  Along the way, our engineering team has grown from 2 to 4 and stayed true to its startup roots.  



We pride ourselves in being an engineering-focused group that moves quickly and builds great customer experiences while having tons of fun along the way.  We're a team of misfits that have come from companies like Amazon.com, Apple, Google, Microsoft, CMU and MIT.  

##How do people apply?

Please send email to jobs@cardpool.com and we'll be in touch!

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Some of the interesting technical and business challenges we're working on include real-time inventory management, dynamic pricing problems, high-performance processing of big data, security, data mining, API design and ping-pong matchmaking algorithms :)



The ideal candidate would be excited by the prospect of working on a small group of highly technical engineers and okay with having a ton of responsibility and learning on the job.  Prior experience working on any of the aforementioned areas, ruby on rails and web development is a plus but not a requirement.  We strongly believe that talent and motivation is a better predictor of success than experience.
