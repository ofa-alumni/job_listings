##What is great about your company?

Yesware is the best place to work in Boston. Brad Feld wrote about our culture as "The Monastic Startup." Smart, accomplished, sane people working in a quiet, focused environment. We’re a hard-work, low-hassle organization: very few meetings, flexible schedules and our vacation policy is “there is no vacation policy.”



We've proved our product effectiveness with over 80,000 salespeople and some amazing customer testimonials (http://www.yesware.com/testimonials) but there's a lot more to do.



We use technologies like Ruby, Rails, REST, Javascript, jQuery and Mongo.  We employ practices like Behavior Driven Development, Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration and peer code review to make the best product possible.  We use the best tools money can buy.



Yesware is backed by top-tier ventures firms Google Ventures (Rich Miner) and the Foundry Group (Brad Feld.) We’re located in between South Station, Downtown Crossing and Chinatown in downtown Boston MA. If you are looking to work at a fast moving but sane startup in Boston, please get in touch.

##How do people apply?

Please send me an email (matthew@yesware.com) with your goals for your next job and the areas where you want to contribute. If you have a current resume that would be great, or you can send me a portfolio/dribble/github link. 



These positions are all based in Boston. Relocation assistance is available, and we'd love to help bring more great people to this great city. 



Thanks for your consideration, 



Matthew Bellows

Founder and CEO

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are hiring great back-end and front-end programmers, an experienced analytical marketer, an inside sales leader, a "Customer Confidence Advocate" (aka a post-sales account owner), and a hiring/office manager. Most of those positions aren't posted on our site because we don't want just anyone to apply. Folks from the Obama campaign definitely cross the "not just anyone" threshold at the start.
