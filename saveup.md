##What is great about your company?

As America comes out of the recession we need new innovative ways to help people succeed financially.  SaveUp is leading the way by using the best of behavioral economics, game mechanics and social dynamics to build a whole new personal finance motivation site.  Co-founded by two social entrepreneurs - Priya Haji (Stanford BA & Berkeley MBA) and Sammy Shreibati (CTO, Stanford CS) and venture backed, we are committed to driving a new experience in financial services.  



SaveUp is the nation's first rewards game for saving money and reducing debt where users get the chance to win prizes from vacations, gift cards to a $2M jackpot.  People can register any financial account at any bank (our back-end is Intuit data aggregation).  For every dollar saved (in a savings account, IRA, 401k, etc.) or every dollar of debt paid  down, users earn SaveUp credits which can be used to play for a wide range of prizes sponsored by advertisers like Banana Republic, Gamestop, Virgin America.  Each day SaveUp also offers financial education, personal challenges, and the opportunity to engage with personalized financial planning.  



People across the US are loving SaveUp, they are saying that it not only is a fun daily ritual but it is helping them succeed financially.  Daily engagement is 20%, weekly 45% and retention is excellent.  Independent study shows the majority of users actually saved more money and reduced more debt.  Our current users are people between 25-45, 60% female and 40% male who are incomes between $50k-$100k - the middle class of America who need success in this recovery. 



The key challenge ahead of SaveUp is scaling to bring our rewards game to the mainstream - and to help millions of Americans achieve financial recovery in a fun new way.  We are growing through reaching people through user invites, social media, partners and financial institutions.  We have a partnership to expand SaveUp through 3,000 credit unions and now working on major employers.  



We are looking for a few passionate people who want to create an innovative new technology to revolutionize personal finance - by actually making it a fun game! 



SaveUp is backed by True Ventures and Blue Run Ventures, has revenue from banks and financial institutions, and just closed a round of funding including multi-national investors from financial services.  We have the capital behind us to make this a success.
