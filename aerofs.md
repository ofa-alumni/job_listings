##What is great about your company?

AeroFS is solving fundamentally fun and hard problems in the system software space. Not only are we building a world class fully distributed and decentralized syncing and collaboration tool, we're also trying to redefine today's view of the "cloud".



Our team is small (there are about a dozen of us today) and we're growing quickly. Because AeroFS touches almost every layer in the technology stack, you will have the opportunity to work on both incredibly low-level and high-level problems. Because of the size of our team you will be "CEO" of whatever you create.



Located in the heart of downtown Palo Alto, we are backed by some of the world's best investors. We are more than just a startup, we are a family: We're close friends and enjoy spending time together. We host tech talks weekly to expand our knowledge, give back to the community through events such as Habitat for Humanity, and most importantly, we love what we do.
