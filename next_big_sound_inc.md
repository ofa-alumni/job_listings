##What is great about your company?

Next Big Sound is a leading provider of music analytics and insights. 



Next Big Sound merges billions of social music data points for hundreds of thousands of artists from the most relevant streaming sites and social networks (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Soundcloud, Wikipedia, Last.fm etc.) with customers’ proprietary sales data. For the first time, artists and the industry can track an artist’s .com traffic, unit sales and radio data alongside social media networks and promotional events to measure results and gain actionable insight from activity, both online and off. The Next Big Sound Premier platform allows the measurement and granular visualization of fan density, sales and site traffic in powerful graphs, by geographic region, as well as weekly email reports to help inform decisions. 



The music industry has undergone a dramatic transformation over the last ten years and their high profile battle with the move from physical to digital has been well publicized. The industry was built for the industrial age, when shelf space was the scarcity. As we move to the information economy, attention is the real indicator of something reacting in the marketplace and a leading barometer for future traditional popularity and financial success. In addition to tracking sales, attention and engagement also need to be accurately measured and can now be monitored at a more granular level than ever before given the explosion in public social music sites. Before Next Big Sound the industry had no way to collect and make sense of the billions of social data points and how they relate to their core business metrics. By aggregating all of these numbers in a centralized dashboard, the fragmented way people listen to music can be aggregated and understood.



Next Big Sound is used by thousands of individual bands and managers as well as the biggest labels and distributors in the world. Next Big Sound powers the Social 50 and Next Big Sound branded chart for Billboard Magazine.
