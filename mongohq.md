##What is great about your company?

Our company builds infrastructure, which is the best kind of company to work for if you're a technologist. We spend our time building products that let our customers do amazing things, and value hackers more than most organizations.



We're trying to build a culture that lets smart people do their thing on whatever they think is important. Anyone can start/own a project, recruit others to work on their baby, and do whatever necessary to deliver it to users. There are 10 of us right now, and we want people who buy in and help us make a better company for the next hire.

##How do people apply?

Email hello@mongohq.com with all the normal stuff (Github profile, Twitter, etc) and some kind of detail that makes you stand out. We like jokes about cats ... among other things.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We have lots of engineering, marketing and ops projects need love. We don't hire for specific roles, exactly, but here's a sample of the skills/experience we're currently hungry for:



* Core infrastructure and virtualization

* Devops, managing hundreds of servers

* Sales funnel development, making our products better at bringing in revenue

* Evangelism (blogging, speaking at conferences, etc)

* UI, both rich browser app and command line

* Database expertise: we need more smarts about more databases



Our stack is largely Node.js, Rails, MongoDB and Redis. We don't have any particular attachment to these tools, they just work well for what we've tackled so far. We've been known to toy around with every from Go and Clojure to HBase and Graphite as well.
