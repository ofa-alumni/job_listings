##What is great about your company?

1. Challenging Environment

Food data is unbelievably messy, which makes our work both exciting and challenging. Consuming, normalizing, extending, visualizing, deriving insights from, and selling food data is what we do every day. If this sounds like a fun way to spend your time, then we’d love to talk.



2. Fun

You should enjoy work and have a little fun sometimes. We encourage anything you need to have a good time.  Whether it’s a regular ping pong game, an after-hours beer tasting or an all night coding marathon with other employees (Good luck beating Eric), we will try it out. To get a sense of what we mean, check out the “Curry Crawl” that we did with our friends at IDEO in January 2012. http://vimeo.com/41318739



3. Respect for Work/Life Balance

We work hard when we’re in the office but also appreciate time at home with our families. There are no set hours and no fixed vacation / sick policy; we expect you to get your work done and respect that you’re enough of an adult to figure out how to make that happen.



4. Perks

Food Genius has a competitive compensation package. In addition to your salary, we offer:

- generous health benefits

- fully paid, unlimited monthly CTA pass

- fantastic food: team lunch on Thursdays, fresh fruit delivered weekly, stocked fridge, regular team dinners, and we’re all bringing in crazy food regularly

- workspace of your choosing (laptop, monitors, whatever)

- convenient loft-style office in River North that’s close to trains, busses, and downtown

##How do people apply?

Email careers@getfoodgenius.com or ecooper@getfoodgenius.com with a cover letter, copy of your resume, and links to anything we should be looking at (projects, github profiles, funny cat videos, etc.)

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Food Genius strives to bring never before seen data reporting to the food industry. In the next 6 months, we are looking to build a system that can understand and report consumer behaviors while eating out and predict food trends with scary accuracy. As a part of the team you will be intimately involved in the research, design, prototyping, building, implementation and launch of our data products regardless of position.  



We’re a Python shop that ships platforms built on a variety of modern tools and services--from “big data” platforms like Hadoop and Cassandra to traditional PostgreSQL deployments to provisioning through Puppet to packages like Django and numpy to angularjs on the front-end. 



We need additional designers, engineers (back and front), and data scientists. Experience in any of the above is a plus, but a love for rapidly hypothesizing, testing, and implementing solutions is what Food Genius emphasizes.
