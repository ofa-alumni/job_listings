##What is great about your company?

Nyaya Health (‘nyaya’ meaning ‘justice’ in Nepali) is a young, growing organization committed to doing whatever it takes to build transparent, data-driven health systems for Nepal’s rural poor. In 2011, the organization was distinguished by the rigorous evaluator GiveWell as a standout organization, (only 10 of over 800 organizations examined have ever received this distinction) for the ability to deliver health care in a very poor region of Nepal with unusual levels of transparency.

##How do people apply?

Please send the materials below to humanresources@nyayahealth.org with “Director of Technology Application OR Creative Director Application – Your Name” in the subject line of the email.

Tell us (or show us) your story, and why you’re committed to doing whatever it takes to bring health care to the rural poor in Nepal. Just make it fit on one page and break free from the confines of the traditional cover letter.
