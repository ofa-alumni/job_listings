##What is great about your company?

The people you'll get to work with are - well, my favorite people in the world. We've got stellar growth, even in silicon valley terms, so that's a nice bonus, but we want people that want to work with other humble people that excel at their jobs, reallllly enjoy what our company provides for groups and existing networks, doesn't buy in to to the normal hype-bs of the startup-world (the kind that surrounds us in SoMa), but most importantly, comes to work every day excited about what they'll get to implement and excited about what they'll get to learn.
