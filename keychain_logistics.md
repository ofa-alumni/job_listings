##What is great about your company?

Logistics sounds pretty boring. But the technical chalenges and data behind logistics (long-haul truckload, less than truckload, and intermodal) is all too fascinating. At Keychain we see the economy moving on a second-to-second basis; we are optimizing capacity and fulfillment; making trucking more economical; more green; and shrinking the overall size of the market. Our goal here is to make an inefficient market efficient, and to put more money in the pockets of truckers, while reducing the cost to shippers (while insuring high quality and a high probability of fulfillment). Think Uber/Hipmunk/priceline for trucking.
