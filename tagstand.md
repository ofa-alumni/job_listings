##What is great about your company?

Technology should enable us. Too often our smartphones don't do that, adding frustration to our lives rather than freeing us. We believe that near-field technology, low energy bluetooth, and a host of other lives can reclaim the joy and delight that was once present in mobile technology.



Beyond just the vision, on a daily basis, we tool around with hardware, work on the design of mobile apps and websites, and work with exciting partners (Google, retail brands, you name it).  There is a certain joy that can be gained from working with physical products and touch based interactions -- we are lucky to have that joy be part of our daily lives.
