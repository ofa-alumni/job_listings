##What is great about your company?

We have set out to build a better bank, to destabilize the banking industry, and to be an example of ethical capitalism. That's some pretty cool shit if you ask me. What's better is that we've built a team of truly wonderful, extremely talented people to do it. While we're very serious about our mission, we're not too serious about much else, and we do our best to have as much fun as possible working together. If that sounds interesting, check us out.
