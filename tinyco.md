##What is great about your company?

TinyCo is an amazing company that makes mobile games. Located in downtown San Francisco, our current popular titles include Tiny Monsters, Tiny Village, and Tiny Zoo. In the last few months, though, we've also been releasing a bunch of new games, including Super Slots, Guess!, and Spellstorm, and have more on the way! We have Series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz and Ron Conway, and are growing very rapidly!
