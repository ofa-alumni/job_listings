##What is great about your company?

We are a group of passionate engineers in love with technology working in the fast paced mobile arena.  Culture is king for us.  We focus on collaboration and constant improvement in ourselves and our products.  We practice agile software development.  We host Meetups.  We get MacBook Pros.  We set time aside for personal projects with our “Days of Impact”.   We hacked up a robotic pigeon-shooting owl.  We have “summer hours”, a pool/Foosball/Ping-Pong table, a balcony, a hot tub time machine, free pop and good beer on tap.
