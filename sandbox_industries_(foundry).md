##What is great about your company?

We're a group of people starting startups, but with the love and support of each other, and resources and funding from Sandbox Industries.  



Working at Sandbox provides startup-oriented folks an opportunity to fail (and fail and fail and fail) and then hopefully start something successful, but to do it with a salary that provides stability, with the guidance and learnings that have come from many group failures and successes, and with an entire team of creative specialists ready and waiting to make the magic happen.  



We also have your first few rounds of funding ready to go: our stand-by VC in San Francisco, Right Side Capital Management, will provide seed funding to any idea ready to be built into a prototype that comes from the Sandbox Foundry, and our own fund, the Sandbox Advantage Fund, can typically provide $1-2m to a company when their prototype has reached market traction.  Finally, when it's time to raise a bigger round outside, we'll show you how it's done and work our network to help make the painful process of fundraising slightly less painful.



Over the last 2 years, we've grown the team from 2 people to 50+, and have 3 quickly-growing, revenue-generating startups today (Lab42, doggyloot and CakeStyle) that will generate close to $5m in revenue in 2012.  We're also launching 3 exciting new startups in the coming weeks (Foodini, CareSimply and GetAFive).



Finally, but perhaps most importantly, the team is truly special:loving, helpful, super talented, hard-working, driven and fun to be around.
