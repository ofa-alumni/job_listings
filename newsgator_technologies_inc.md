##What is great about your company?

Founded in 2004, NewsGator transformed the way people consumed information with the use of RSS (Really Simple Syndication). This vision propelled NewsGator into the world of knowledge sharing, collaboration, and ultimately, enterprise-class social business software. NewsGator has since thrived largely as a function of two attributes: pace of innovation and a fanatical focus on customer satisfaction.



As a Microsoft Gold Certified and Globally Managed Partner, NewsGator is helping over four million paid users in industries across the globe propel the future of productivity. NewsGatorâ€™s flagship solution -  Social Sites - delivers robust social technology to the enterprise with proven scalability and security. Flagship clients include: Accenture, Adidas, Deloitte, Ericsson, General Mills, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Kraft Foods, Merck & Co., Unisys Corporation, and the US Army.



No other social software vendor can match our deep integration with the Microsoft stack. Customers reap rewards such as reduced total cost of ownership and swift user adoption and we get kudos such as being honored by Microsoft as its 2011 US Partner of the Year.
