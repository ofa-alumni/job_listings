##What is great about your company?

We’re building innovative software that helps fix our nation’s broken healthcare system.  We make sure that patients get the care they need and doctors get the referral revenue they deserve.  This two-minute video about Fibroblast tells more of our story (http://www.fibroblast.com/blog/article_id/126).  We take on big challenges; we don’t settle; we come hard in the paint; and we have fun.



Fibroblast is a proud member of Excelerate Labs’ 2012 Class, which was recently ranked the #3 accelerator program in the US.  Being part of Excelerate Labs offers unparalleled access to world-class technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs, investors, and thought-leaders, as well as exposure to the Chicago and national tech community.  Our office is in 1871—it’s awesome.
