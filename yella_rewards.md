##What is great about your company?

We are revolutionizing the way customers voice their opinions about their shopping and dining experiences.  We are essentially crowdsourcing management and operations in the service industry.  



Our goal is to enhance the customer experience globally.  



You will have the opportunity to see people use your product every time you walk into a large chain quick serve/retail outlet.  



Subway Restaurants is highly interested in adopting Yella Rewards.  

##How do people apply?

Just shoot me an email at adam@yellarewards.com, and we'll take it from there.  

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We need a Data Architect/Data Scientist.  We will be handling an extremely large amount of data.  Having Subway and McDonalds adopt our product would account for millions of data points daily.   





We offer equity, competitive salary, and a work atmosphere that encourages creativity and getting things done.
