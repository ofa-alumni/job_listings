##What is great about your company?

We're a fast growing startup that's still at the fun point between being big enough to pay our bills, and small enough to be a blast to work at. Much like the vaunted OFA opportunity, we're using data to learn about customers, and help out clients personalize how they communicate to them. Clients who use our platform are getting 40%+ better conversion, and thousands of dollars return on investment very week.



Run by a serial entrepreneur who has built a number of successful organizations and a rock-star technical team.
