##What is great about your company?

We're a small team of brilliant developers targeting a multi-billion dollar market, have a clear path to revenue, fanatical users and are backed by top-tier investors.

##How do people apply?

Please send your github handle or something you've built to jobs@getyardsale.com

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're a Rails/iOS shop, looking for a generalist or iOS specialist. We're interested in speaking with individuals who:



- Above all, learn quickly



- Have a strong understanding of everything from optimized PostgreSQL to performance hacking UIWebViews



- Seek out the latest in tooling, iOS open source or clang features



This is a key technical hire, with significant equity and lots of room to influence the strategic direction of the company. The best fit will probably be someone hoping to be a technical founder in their next role.
