##What is great about your company?

We are going after the $350B secondary IT market by bringing simplicity and price transparency to a process that is currently painful, ugly and untrustworthy. Enterprises discard billions worth of IT equipment every year because it's less painful than selling that equipment. We're fixing that.



Wholesalers are paying us $1000/mo to be here, enterprises have uploaded millions in inventory, we're doing $3-500k per month in transactions and have closed a $1.1M seed round -- all since getting started in late April.

##How do people apply?

Email me at ben@markitx.com. Let me know what kind of problems you like to work on.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're looking for our founding data scientist, our lead engineer and a front-end developer. More than looking to fill specific positions, we are looking to build a team of people that can operate at all levels of the stack. We want people who can look at a problem deeply, prototype a solution, deploy it, test it and iterate.
