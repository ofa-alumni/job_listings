##What is great about your company?

We are on a mission to make sense of the measured world and we want you to join our team. 



At Tempo, we are building a time series database service that enables the storage and analysis of massive streams of measurement data that break traditional databases. Our technology makes it possible to measure more about our environment, our infrastructure, and ourselves, and to learn about and improve our world. This is a huge opportunity, but we need smart, passionate team members to help us solve the hard problems we face. 



We are a very small team and want you to become a core member of our company. We will look to you to lead with both ideas and execution and to collaborate on the architecture and implementation of our technology, our business, and our organization. You will lead development efforts to add new functionality to our service while continuously improving reliability, performance, and security. You will solve hard data storage and analysis problems at massive scale. 



You will also be asked to weigh in on everything from business strategy to recruiting, UI design to company culture, customer service to where to go for lunch, and we value team members who have an opinion. We also value self-motivation, a never-ending need to learn, flexibility, a desire to do things the right way, Internet of Things/Personal Informatics geekery, and an appreciation for the occasional adult beverage. If this sounds like you, then join our team and help us achieve our mission to make sense of the measured world.
