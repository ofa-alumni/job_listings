##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Because our team is less than 10 people, we're looking for people who are high energy and excellent self starters, and who want to help us continue our insane growth trajectory. If you love empowering small business owners, the beauty industry, working at an extremely fast pace with a fairly hilarious team, this could be the right fit for you.
