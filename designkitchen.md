Here is our generic full job description:



Senior User Experience Designer

Ready for an opportunity to flex your UX design muscle and expand your digital expertise for a major, communications company with a Chicago legacy?

Designkitchen here, and we’re on the hunt for a passionate Senior UX designer who’s been grinding for 5-8 years to create engaging, cross-channel, digital experiences on a global scale. To acquire a desk in our West Loop space, you should know how to apply iterative, user-focused research and design principles to create deliverables like sitemaps, wireframes, and prototypes of varying fidelity levels. You also must be able to put your head together with virtually every single one of our teams to come up with practical solutions that work with any time and budget constraints. Our work crosses the web, mobile and social spaces.  It’s fun and fast paced – let’s go!

By the way, this is NOT a visual design position. This role is an exciting mélange of user research, interactive design, information architecture, and usability evaluation, with a bit of content and business strategy sprinkled on top. At DK, we like getting down to the sweet business of understanding brands and users, and creating experiences for them that work well and feel special – a worthwhile treat. And so should you.

Like with any UX designer position, you’ll need to possess exceptional critical-thinking, time-management, research, and presentation skills. Be ready to brainstorm interaction concepts early and often, think outside the box and throw the frickin’ box away. As a senior member of the team, we’ll also be counting on you to mentor junior colleagues. You’ll be setting goals for them and giving performance feedback, recognizing their contributions and encouraging their development.

A couple keys to a successful User Experience Designer...

Understand your target audience as well as clients’ business and brand strategies.

·        Come to work with a good grasp of users’ wants, needs, expectations and current behaviors. Document these findings through personas, experience models, and discovery findings presentations.

·        Suggest and prioritize features and functionality and creative strategies that integrate these needs with client objectives.

Communicate your ideas clearly and confidently to clients and cross-discipline teams.

·        Define the information architecture for a site and document proposed page hierarchies, navigation schemas, taxonomy and nomenclature by creating a sitemap.

·        Create interaction diagrams and page level wireframes that are clear and thorough. Know what level of fidelity is appropriate to communicate the site vision to all who are involved in the project.

·        Lead user experience discussions and present work directly to clients. You must be able to speak and write clearly and persuasively, as well as be able to listen and get clarification. You must respond well to questions and participate actively in meetings and reviews.

Plan and facilitate user tests and make sense of test findings.

·        Suggest appropriate evaluation activities to help internal and client teams understand how users interact with an interface.  Have a varied toolkit to choose from – card sorts, concept tests and usability evaluation included.

·        Plan and facilitate testing sessions, whether formal in a lab with a Law and Order mirror, or quick and dirty guerilla-style.  You’ll be responsible for the whole shebang from recruiting through to moderation.

·        Summarize findings and prioritize recommendations.  Present our thinking to client teams.  Hopefully by now you’ve realized this is a heavily client-facing role.

Work as a mentor.

·        Provide challenging and stretching tasks and assignments for direct reports.

·        Review the work of more junior team members and provide direction and feedback.

·        Hold development discussions and be aware of junior team members’ career goals.

·        Assist with recruiting, hiring, new employee onboarding and training.

 Requirements

·        5+ years experience (preferably in an agency or consulting setting) applying iterative, user-centered research and design principles to create deliverables such as sitemaps, wireframes and prototypes of varying fidelity levels

·        Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field; graduate degree a plus

·        A solid understanding of and experience with the entire digital ecosystem – web, mobile and social

· Ability to independently apply expertise on our larger, higher priority accounts.  B2B experience a plus

·        Excellent client service, communication and collaboration skills

·        Strong know

·        Experience leading small teams

·        Familiarity with a variety of software including the Adobe Creative Suite (particularly InDesign) and Omnigraffle
