##What is great about your company?

Grouper sets up drinks between 2 groups of friends: 3 guys and 3 girls, or 3 guys and 3 guys, etc. Our business has been growing like crazy, doubling in the last month alone, and we have a lot of fun putting a dent in the universe.



Why is being part of Grouper the best job in the world?



1) WE SOLVE HARDER PROBLEMS.

Getting people together offline is a hard problem. Matching algorithms, logistics optimizations, customer service AI, a real-time CRM. Web scale is boring. Offline scale is uncharted terrain



2) WE HAVE MORE FUN.

Grouper is about having fun and making life more interesting. And we practice what we preach. We all go on Groupers, have epic happy hours and events, and generally enjoy the real world. After all, that is what we're all about.



3) WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL

Grouper has what economic historians like to a call a "business model." This gives us leverage to do what we want. We've also raised funding from some of the best investors in the world to help us grow even faster.



4) WE'RE IMPROVING LIVES. ONE DRINK AT A TIME :)

We want to leave the world a little better than we found it. For us, that means helping people do the things that really matter -- like spending time with friends, new and old and forming great memories.

##How do people apply?

Email a resume, a link to your Github profile or Dribbble profile, and a short email cover e-mail to jobs@joingrouper.com

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're looking for talented full stack engineers to tackle one of three general areas: web products, our iOS app, or growth products. 



We're also looking for designers with experience in graphic design, illustration, print, and web/UX design (HTML/CSS coding ability preferred).



We're paying market salary with insanely great benefits and huge amounts of equity, because are team is still so small.
