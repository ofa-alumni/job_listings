##What is great about your company?

Our goal is to make the world more energy efficient—and we have some pretty good ideas about how to make that happen. But what separates great ideas from products and solutions with the potential to change the world are the people who bring them to life.

As an Oployee, you will have the opportunity to work in a variety of specialties in the company—marketing, analytics, engagement management, sales, regulatory affairs, and more! Our teams are directly responsible for the enormous positive impact we’ve had to date: the amount of power we save will soon equal what’s produced by the entire US solar industry. We’ve already saved enough energy to take a city the size of New Orleans off the grid entirely!
