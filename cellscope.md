##What is great about your company?

CellScope is a mobile health startup based in San Francisco. We're creating attachments to smartphones along with an app and web backend to enable medical imaging and remote diagnosis. Our first product is a smartphone otoscope for looking inside kids' ears for ear infection. There are 30 million ear infection-related visits to the doctor every year in the US alone. Our otoscope will not only be used by medical professionals in the clinic and hospital setting but also by parents in the home. For parents, our device enables them to capture a high-quality diagnostic ear image of their sick child from the comfort of home, transmit it to a doctor for a remote diagnosis. If antibiotics are needed, they can be called in directly to the parent's local pharmacy. Our device gives parents peace of mind and doctors the ability to capture images for medical training and parent education. It provides a digital record to visually capture the state of the ear over time. 

What's great about our company is that we are focused on fundamentally disrupting healthcare delivery. Our vision goes beyond ear imaging and we envision a world where people use our products and services to reduce the number of unnecessary hospital visits, save time and money, and get peace of mind. We are a 3 person startup so our first hire will have a lot of impact on the direction and culture of the company.
