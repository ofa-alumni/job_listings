##What is great about your company?

Inventables is the hardware store for designers. The company is attempting to bring manufacturing from the factory to the desktop making it as accessible as desktop publishing.  Inventables sells machines and supplies for small business manufactures to make products ranging from jewelry and signs to furniture.  Inventables catalog has about 30,000 products most of which if ordered by 3pm are shipped the same day.



We are working on a new part of our website that will decouple design from manufacturing making it possible for designers from all over the world to design physical products, specify the materials, and earn royalties when manufacturers download their designs and make their products.  Since the cost of manufacturing equipment has fallen to a few thousand or in some cases a few hundred dollars we believe this is going to accelerate job growth in the United States for manufacturing custom "long tail" products.  We experienced a similar phenomenon with the music industry where once the tools to make music became inexpensive and accessible there was an explosion of "long tail" artists that didn't need to go through the traditional channels or record company A&R to get their music out to the world.



We are a small team of 8 people and just hired Edward Ford the inventor of the Shapeoko CNC mill that we sell for $600.  Edward is a luminary in desktop fabrication and since we now control the materials, machine, and the web experience we believe we are in a unique position to change the way manufacturing is done globally.
