##What is great about your company?

We're trying to change the way people are entertained and informed.



Showyou is an award-winning video app for the iPad and iPhone. The Apple AppStore named Showyou one of "10 Essential Social Networking" apps, along with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, SoundCloud, and Pinterest.



We want to make Showyou the best video app ever made for smartphones and tablets; an app that people love to use as a result of simple, beautiful UI as well as sophisticated and practical use of large amounts of data. An app that gives you great things to watch every day; programming that makes you smarter, better informed, that brings a smile to your face, or makes you laugh harder than you thought possible.



It's an audacious mission, but we’re still a small team -- just six right now with plans to grow to 10 by end of this year. So you'll have a chance to make a significant, and immediate, impact. We're backed by TrueVentures (an amazing VC firm that also backs MakerBot, WordPress, and other great companies).



We have great offices in both San Francisco (Jackson Square, between the Financial District and North Beach) and downtown Portland. Both offices are convenient to public transit, coffee and great food. Don’t live in Portland or SF? We can work with you to fix that.  And if you can’t relocate, but think this is the perfect opportunity for you, we’re still happy to hear from you.

##How do people apply?

Send an email to Mark Hall, the founder & CEO of the company and more importantly still an Obama volunteer in '08 (precinct captain for Cali primary, field office volunteer in Muncie IN for primary and Jackson, OH for general) and '12. 



Mark's email is mark@remixation.com, and mobile phone is 415.312.2835

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're also looking for people who can help us build and manage our rapidly community -- both the people who use Showyou to watch and share great programming, and the people and companies that make that programming.
