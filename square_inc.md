##What is great about your company?

Square is a fast growing, ambitious startup with the audacious mission of revolutionizing commerce as we know it. We empower individuals and small businesses, which are major contributors in our nation's economic growth.



I love Square's vision, and love working here.  It is a lot of work, but I have the privilege of working with so many extremely talented (and fun!) individuals. I am constantly learning.



I was lucky enough to visit OFA HQ a few weeks ago, and got the impression that many of you would fit in great at Square!

##How do people apply?

If you're interested, apply via the Jobvite links on the page. I'm happy to be a contact point for you as well (especially for engineering). Email me at mthole@squareup.com.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We have a ton of opportunities available, across business, engineering, and design. I am personally an engineering manager, and am looking for talented iOS, back-end server (e.g. Ruby, Java, etc), and web (e.g. JS, Ember, etc) engineers. Mostly we're just looking for extremely smart, talented, and passionate people.



We also have many opportunities in business and creative, although I am less personally involved there. I can hook you up with the appropriate people, though.
