##What is great about your company?

We're trying to change the way kids think about the world.  And we're doing it with thousands and thousands of tiny robots.  We think that we can make kids a lot smarter than we are by helping them learn about complexity, and how lots of independent little things can give rise to emergent behavior like societies, environmental problems, or politics.  That solutions to complex problems can't be ham-fisted, that the real world is more nuanced than black or white, red or blue.  We design and manufacture robot construction kits.
