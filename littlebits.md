##What is great about your company?

We spend more than 7.5 hours with technological devices every day, but most us don't know how they work, or how to make our own. For all the interactivity of these devices, we are bound to passive consumption. 



At littleBits, we believe we need to create the next generation problem-solvers, and interventions need to occur early. The time is ripe to create the pipe cleaner and the popsicle stick of the 21st century.



We are a mission driven startup based in New York. In less than one year, we’ve been featured in the New York Times magazine, acquired by MoMA for the museum’s collection, and called by Bloomberg TV “LEGO for the iPad generation“. We launched 2 kits and over 28 bits, won MAKE Magazine editor’s choice award, and Best of Toy Fair 2012 and got featured in a TED talk with over 500k views. We are well funded (closed a seed round of 850k and a Series A of 3.65mn), have a great team (11 people) and are looking to grow.
