##What is great about your company?

NoRedInk.com is an adaptive learning tool that helps students improve their grammar/writing skills.  Our engine generates personalized curriculum from students' interests and adapts to their abilities with instant feedback, tutorials, and color-coded heat maps.  With no marketing, we're already in 4% of U.S. schools.  We won NBC's $75,000 Innovation Challenge in September and have been featured on the TODAY show, Mashable, TechCrunch, MSN.com, US News & World Report, and Hack Education.  We're backed by ImagineK12 and led by an English teacher who, after grading 15,000 papers, decided to leverage technology to eliminate "red ink."
