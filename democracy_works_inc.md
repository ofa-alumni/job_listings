##What is great about your company?

We make voting easy. We help create voter registration and ballot request forms, and mail them to voters complete with addressed, stamped envelopes for their local election offices, so all they have to do is sign & send.



Over the next two years, we plan to build additional tools to help election administrators process all these forms and requests more easily (and move voter registration online in more states). By 2016, we'll be a core part of the election infrastructure (which will finally look like a modern, convenient process).



We're a still-small Rails shop. We love apple pie, trivia night, and bow ties on Tuesday.
