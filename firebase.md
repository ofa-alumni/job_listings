##What is great about your company?

Firebase is a Y-Combinator backed company founded in August 2011. The team is small (6) and all technical. 



Firebase is the fastest way to build an app. It allows developers to write apps using only front-end code. By abstracting the need for a server -- similar to how Amazon abstracts the need for a physical server -- Firebase lets developers build apps faster and allows developers focus on solving their customers problems without worrying about scaling or sharding.



They are based in San Francisco and have almost 10,000 developers signed up to use their private beta.
