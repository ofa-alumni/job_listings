##What is great about your company?

We have built a next-generation analytics tool specifically geared for the media industry -- editors, journalists, and analysts at top publishers.



Parse.ly Dash, our flagship product, is already used by editors at The Atlantic, US News, Mashable, Reuters, and ArsTechnica, among many other sites.



Our data challenges are big: we process 3.5B pageviews/month across more than 10 million unique URLs. Our team, however, is small -- only ~10 employees.



For the more technically and design-minded, you can read a blog post we wrote about how we implemented a new feature -- an analytics-rich weekly email digest -- as a team: http://blog.parsely.com/post/34241210620/whatever-it-takes
