##What is great about your company?

We're a team of second time entrepreneurs, tackling the massive payroll market. If solving a real pain point for millions of people gets you excited (plus the chance to build a billion dollar company), we'd love to speak with you. We have big ambitions and the funding and resources to make long term bets. We've raised a large round from an all-star list of investors and are looking for like-minded engineers to join us.



There's a ton of work to be done, and you'll be a core member of our team as we grow the company. You'll receive a highly competitive salary, a sizable equity stake, and we'll geek you out with whatever equipment you need to get your work done. 



Other perks include a housing stipend if you live near the office, 3 meals/day, company retreats, gym stipend, and more. Our office is one block from South Park in SoMa, San Francisco.



Above all, we're looking for individuals who are yearning to do the best work of their lives. You'll be amply rewarded for the work you do.
