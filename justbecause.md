##What is great about your company?

We make an iPhone app called JustBecause that lets people send friends gifts that cost $1 but are worth way more -- like an Uber ride up to $20 or a t-shirt from Betabrand. We currently partner with Uber, Birchbox, Warby Parker, TaskRabbit, Betabrand, Trunk Club, BucketFeet, and other exciting consumer-facing companies.



We're building a purchase micro-influence graph and using that data exhaust to build an entirely new type of mobile e-commerce platform.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are a small, technology-driven startup. So if you love coding and being responsible for building an app from the ground-up, learning from and with people who have done startups before, we're interested in talking with you. Specifically, we're looking to augment our mobile development team (current app is iOS) and also build an Android version of our app.
