##What is great about your company?

Health care communication in the US is broken.  As a result of poor communication and other preventable medical errors, close to 100,000 people die each year.  It is the sixth biggest killer annually.  In addition, poor communication leads to $10 billion in losses per year in US hospitals.  



At Medigram, we want to change this.  We want to replace the current forms of communication like pagers and fax machines with technology available in most other industries.  We have proven the value of our application at 10 hospitals around the country where Medigram is being used.  These institutions include Stanford Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital.  



If you want to make a difference and help change the most broken industry in the US for the better, we would love to talk to you.  Join Medigram and lets work together to bring health care into the 21st century.
