##What is great about your company?

We're exploring and hoping to improve the way that people find, read, and share stories on the Internet. We're a small team of 10 and want to keep it that way, but it's time to move a little bit faster and take advantage of what we think is a pretty huge opportunity to restore the Digg brand to its former greatness.

##How do people apply?

Thanks!
