##What is great about your company?

Amazon Music is made up of approximately 140 people in downtown San Francisco.   



We operate like a start-up with the financial backing and long-term view of Amazon.  



It is an amazing team focused on innovating in the Music and audio entertainment space.  We use what we call a "2 pizza rule".  Once a team gets large enough that it takes more than 2 pizzas to feed them we look to divide them into 2 teams.  It helps us stay fast and innovative.



We have International implementations across multiple platforms and devices from Kindle, Web, iOS, Android and more.   



It's fun, challenging and we work hard to make things easy for our users.

##How do people apply?

I am a friend and work colleague of Scout Addis.

I can also send job descriptions on request. 



Thank you, Paul
