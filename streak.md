##What is great about your company?

We're a YC summer 2011 company working on email. We're two technical co-founders looking to build the core team. We can't build features fast enough to keep up with users' demands and our growth. That's where you come in - we need someone who likes building product, pushing code everyday and making our service fast. At Streak - we're building a product that people love to use. Even though we sell to businesses, we aren't an enterprise company - we're a technology company maniacally focused on a great product. Companies use Streak everyday to make their teams more effective.

##How do people apply?

If you're interested send an email to jobs@streak.com. Include some information about yourself - resume, LinkedIn profile, etc - and links to things you've worked on.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Right now we're only looking for engineers. We need code written on the front-end, back-end and mobile. There are so many interesting challenges in all aspects of the stack that you can leverage the skills you have now, and have the opportunity and areas to learn and develop the skills you want to learn.
