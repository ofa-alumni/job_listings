##What is great about your company?

*We're focused on the Android segment of mobile, which is obviously explosive

*Our products are differentiated because they have a hardware component (don't have to compete directly with 100k s of apps)

*Our hardware is differentiated because of the technology (mostly in software)

*We have a vision that the apps powering our hardware provide real value and differentiation to our users (ie we're not just another crappy alarm clock dock, the app is well thought out and provides meaningful features) 

*We're in the market, generating revenue.  Additional funding should only be needed for growth

*Alarm clocks (including smartphone docking ones) remain an important device for receiving daily news for hundreds of millions of people around the world.  Our hardware and software can influence that.

##How do people apply?

contact jborn@sonrlabs.com

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Despite the fact that we're already in the market with a product, we characterize this position as a "Technical Co-Founder."  With a 4 person team, this position will have the influence and authority of a founder in terms not just of guiding technical direction, but also company strategy as a whole.



We need someone with a developer background, but WE DO NOT NEED HARDWARE EXPERIENCE.  We need a generalist willing to learn who can dive into a broad range of technical challenges as they arise  (it is expected the bulk of time will be spent developing or guiding development of the android mobile software that interfaces with our device)
