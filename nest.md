##What is great about your company?

Nest is a rare combination of cutting edge technologies (AWS, Django, Scala, the thermostat of course), design focused engineering (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Fadell), small size, and world changing potential. It's small enough for engineers to have a large impact within the company, and large enough for the company to have a significant impact on world energy consumption.

##How do people apply?

Contacting me (mark.mcbride@gmail.com) is probably the best first step.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

A bunch. Nest does embedded software, iOS, Android, web site (Django), web services (Scala), analytics, operations, etc. We're located in Palo Alto.
