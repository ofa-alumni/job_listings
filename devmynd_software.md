##What is great about your company?

We're a small and agile consultancy with a very high bar for quality of both our workmanship and the clients we chose to take on.  Most of the folks on our team have been working in software for over a decade and so there's a lot of learning and knowledge sharing that goes on.  We have a great culture and have a lot of fun...our basic philosophy is that you can't do good work unless you're enjoying it ;)

##How do people apply?

Email me, we'll set up a time to have coffee or lunch and go from there.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We have developer positions open for both Ruby/Rails and front-end engineers.  We are also interested in adding some mobile skills to the team.
