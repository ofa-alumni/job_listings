##What is great about your company?

We're making shopping and saving simple for consumersâ€¦ we're helping banks drive value with fees...  We're helping advertisers connect digital to stores. 

We have a database of billions of credit/debit card transactions and ambitions to use it to connect online marketing to taking action offline. Sound familiar?

##How do people apply?

Also, you may feel free to contact our in house recruiter, Michael Doran, directly at: michael.doran@edointeractive.com

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We have numerous job openings currently (viewable on our website), but where we really have the biggest opportunities is in working with the large amounts of data that we receive from our financial institution partners every day.

We need Data Analysts and Data Scientists at all levels. We also need IT infrastructure people (Database administrators and a Data Warehouse Engineer).

We use R and Tableau; Postgres, Hadoop, and VectorWise; Java, Grails, and JavaScript; DevOps and automated testing.
