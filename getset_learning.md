##What is great about your company?

Online learning is painful. Barely 25% of students attending online universities graduate on time. Yet there's so much potential for democratizing learning through the internet. Our stealth-mode education startup is dedicated to making online learning deeply engaging and personalized. Our founder, Karan Goel, is the former CEO and co-founder of PrepMe, creators of the world's first adaptive learning platform. PrepMe beat to market competitors who had raised ten times the capital and was acquired by Providence Equity in July 2011, two weeks after they acquired Blackboard.  We already have a number of large colleges signed up for our upcoming beta.



We're lifelong learners passionate about making education easier and more engaging. We have a chance to impact hundreds of thousands of students when we launch, and already have paying customers for our beta. We're a lean startup that is short on ritual, dogma, and bureaucracy, long on science, data, and joie de vivre. We value great ideas, rapid execution, and fast feedback. We work hard, but have fun doing it.

##How do people apply?

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're looking for experienced software engineers, data scientists, and technical leaders to join a team of passionate online learning experts, educators, technologists, and designers who want to focus on making online learning work—no hype, just effective, clean, simple online learning that makes an impact on people's lives.



You have deep knowledge of web application development with Ruby on Rails. In addition to Ruby, you’re proficient in Java, Clojure, Scala, or JavaScript. You’re comfortable working with data in many forms: MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j might come into play in various parts of the system. You know how to integrate systems using messaging solutions like RabbitMQ and RESTful services. You write automated unit and functional tests and are comfortable deploying to production many times a day.



You're also a quick study. You know the value of practice and are confident that you could pick up any of the skills in the list above quickly if you don’t already have them mastered. You're curious about the world, fun to be around, and you know how to get things done.



If this sounds like you and you'd like the opportunity to grow a business from the ground up while doing work that matters, we should talk.
