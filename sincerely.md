##What is great about your company?

Sincerely makes apps for iPhone and Android that enable people to send cards and gifts to the people they care about most. If you'd like to check out our apps: Postagram and Ink.



We have a great, inspiring, light-filled office in downtown San Francisco, a block from union square. Our small 20-strong team is product-focused and driven. We emphasize work-life balance, have a laid-back vacation and office hours policy, and get tasty lunch catered to the office every day.

##How do people apply?

Send an email to bryan@sincerely.com

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're actively looking for a front-end web developer with design skills to join our team. Our team is growing rapidly though, so I'd encourage any engineer to apply. There may be a position in Marketing coming in January.
