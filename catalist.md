##What is great about your company?

Catalist works to transform the way the progressive community gets the comprehensive, high quality tools and data they need to be successful. We compile, enhance, store and dynamically update person-level data for the entire U.S. adult population and provide the tools and expertise necessary to plan, analyze, and execute data-driven progressive programs.  Catalist provides a combination of dynamically updated data from billions of actual individual civic behaviors collected from widely diverse sources synthesized into easy to use and potent variables for targeting communications.  Catalist operates as the data “utility” to support progressive organizations.  Our customer are large and small; local, regional, and national; they are advocacy, issue, and election focused.



We build back-end data pipeline systems, front end tools, visualizations, and integrations with other vendors.
