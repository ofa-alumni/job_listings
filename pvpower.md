##What is great about your company?

PVPower opened for business in early ‘09.  Since then we’ve sold millions of dollars of solar components without help from any rock-stars or ninjas that we know of.  Our office is a big and bright loft on the north side of Chicago along the Ravenswood corridor. We also have an office in the financial district of San Francisco. We are an Excelerate Labs company – class of 2010.  A Greentstart company – class of 2012.  We have a strong network of mentors and investors in Chicago, San Francisco, and across the country



We’re in the process of introducing Kiwi, a new consumer solar brand and product to the market. It’s the simplest, highest-value option for homeowners today and it's the future of solar.  It’s green, simple, made-in-the-USA, and a great investment. We need help conveying that message. And there’s a place in our hearts for:



- Creative problem solvers

- Working smart

- Learning new things and teaching others what we’ve learned

- The Earth, its resources, and making sure it’s all still around for our children to enjoy
