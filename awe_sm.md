##What is great about your company?

First and foremost, we're an engineering-driven culture and our primary product is our APIs (http://developers.awe.sm). Our business is providing infrastructure for collecting, processing, and delivering data about the results of sharing activity. Our customers are primarily other developers putting those data to use for everything from business intelligence to data-driven features, like leaderboards and referral rewards, to powering the analytics offerings they show their own customers.



We are a small, close-knit team that values excellent work ethic, collaboration and team spirit at all times. We work quietly but our IRC is always active with both technical arguments and the latest image macros. We eat lunch together every day and have weekly “Show and Tell” tech talks to present and develop new ideas. We enjoy casual dress and flexible hours as well as a truly awesome view from our office in the heart of the Mission.



We promote an engineering-driven culture where personal and technical development are paramount. Our highest company priority is to support and encourage every member of our team to explore their interests first-hand and become better equipped to pursue their life goals.



We offer a competitive salary that comes with a meaningful stock option plan as well as full health, dental, and vision coverage. We have catered lunch 3 days a week, and you get to pick out your own computer and chair when you join.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're basically looking for great engineers across the stack. You can choose the technologies that interest you at http://awe.sm/jobs and we'll bucket you into the most appropriate role.



The role on which we're currently the most focused is what we call Developer Experience Lead (see http://jobs.awe.sm/apply/iXa9QF/Developer-Experience-Lead.html). Our customers are developers, and our success lies in helping them do things better, faster, and cheaper than they could on their own. We’re looking for someone who can understand our platform, help other people use it, and help us improve it through better understanding of our customers’ needs. The title for this position reflects our vision for a cross-functional role that encompasses everything from figuring out what to build, to building those things, to spreading the word about them.
