##What is great about your company?

Apportable is a platform for recompiling iOS games to run on other platforms automatically. We allow Android users to access all the same apps that iPhone and iPad owners currently use and enjoy, without extensive changes to the original Objective-C or C++ code. Apportable is used by many top 100 Android apps today and is growing quickly.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are looking for inventive, passionate software engineers who are interested in tackling the challenge of cross-compilation on iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms. You will work on software that seamlessly re-compiles Objective-C/C++ code for Android without major modifications and produces ports of great games that users love.



Our team is small (10) and we move fast, so we're looking for engineers who can jump into the codebase and work on both the platform itself and on managing individual apps. In a given week, you’ll master a build system, extend our platform, bridge in new third-party libraries (both native and Java), crush bugs, manage a project, and bring a title to market.



Our software uses open source projects like GNUstep, CFLite, and Cocotron as well as our own implementation of UIKit and other libraries. We're adding new titles constantly, so you’ll quickly see your work in the hands of millions of users.
