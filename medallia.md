##What is great about your company?

Medallia’s mission is to defeat mediocrity. We build systems for companies to listen and act on feedback from their customers through surveys and social media. For many of the world’s top companies, Medallia is their key tool for learning how to improve every day.



I love working here because our external mission is even more true internally. I get to work with smart, diverse, interesting, and happy people with a fanatical focus on getting better. I could work from home, but I come into the office instead.



…and we have a cardboard cutout of Obama in our main (Oval Office-themed) conference room.

##How do people apply?

Send me (Peter Kriss, pkriss@medallia.com) an email and we can find a time to chat. I can tell you more about the company and given your interests, figure out the right person for you to talk to next.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We’re growing fast (hired our 200th employee a few months ago), but are still at a size where engineers own projects almost immediately. Our engineering team is hiring at all levels of experience and in nearly all groups – front-end,  UI, text analytics, operations, systems.



We’re also hiring non-engineers. Our Solutions and Services teams (who configure and adapt the system) is a great place for people who want to work with clients. Again, hiring at all levels – from new college grads in any major through those with several years of work experience and/or advanced degrees.
