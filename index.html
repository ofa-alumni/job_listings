Full-stack Generalist - Our Dev team is currently made of two smart generalists who like to tackle any problem. We are always looking for more folks like this who can come in and apply their skill and intelligence to any situation we throw at them, whether it be messing with our CSS, figuring out our batch processes for data ingestion or optimizing our workflow for end users.



Front-end Developer/ Designer: We are regularly complimented on our UI, but we want to take it further. We have made the most of Twitter bootstrap and built a user experience that is enjoyable and provides easy control and transparency for our customers when looking at the advertising campaigns. We want to move from having great experience to the best, especially as we add features to our product that will invite in entirely new audiences including publishers and bloggers.

inDinero has been hauling for about two years now, growing to over a thousand paying business customers, and we're looking for a lead developer!  Both founders (Andy and Jessica) studied computer science before starting the company, and they wrote most of the initial code until product launch.  Today, the company has five full-time developers scattered across the globe, and we're looking for a tech lead who can oversee our team and it's growth as we go from five to thirty.



What will happen day-to-day?



+Spec out new product features with our design team

+Improve our engineering workflow

    -Get feedback from team on how we can speed up their work

    -Make sure the test suite runs faster and is continuously running

    -See that all devs get their technical questions answered promptly

    -Update the dummy databases that our developers test code on

+Prioritize long-term structural improvements to make to our infrastructure

    -Upgrading Rails

    -Using something like mongo to track events

    -Make sure the servers will scale

    -Ensure high security.  Audit code base every quarter.

    -Refactor and modularize key parts of our code base.





Engineering Culture:



+"Push first, fix later":  if the code works, you can always make it prettier later.  What ultimately matters is that it reaches customers ASAP.

+Testing is good, but not the end-all-be-all.  Instead of having an over reliance on automated tests, always smoke test the feature by using it.  

+We don't record bugs on any bug tracker.  If it's not important enough to get fixed today, we'll probably just overhaul the entire feature in a few months and the bug fix will be a waste of time.





Skills we're looking for:



    +Ruby on Rails, 1+ years

    +Java, 2+ years

    +HTML/CSS/Javascript

    +Sysadmin experience (Debian)
