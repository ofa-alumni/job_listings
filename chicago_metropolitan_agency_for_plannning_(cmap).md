##What is great about your company?

We're reinventing how the many moving parts of a great metropolitan region can work  together to solve common problems and plan for a better future.  CMAP's GO TO 2040 regional comprehensive plan (http://cmap.illinois.gov) is backed by (a) a mandate, because it was forged by a multi-year region-wide consensus-building process; (b) concrete implementation steps and (c) a regional indicators tracking system at http://metropulsechicago.org.  

##How do people apply?

Posting is at http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d8581e9d-1576-4df5-9983-5ff133e0d24f&groupId=20583

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Web programmer.  We recently lost one to IBM and another to early retirement due to health problems.  CMAP hosts a diverse set of online tools starting with http://metropulsechicago.org but extending to the workforce development portal http://metropulsechicago.org/jobs, the Full Circle community mapping project (see http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/full-circle) and our nascent open-source CKAN data sharing platform (coming soon at http://opendata.cmap.illinois.gov).  



We're posting this at the assistant level, but for the right candidate, we might have flexibility in the seniority level.
