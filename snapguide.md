##What is great about your company?

Everyone who works here is a passionate maker. We care about making a difference so we set out to build tools to enable other makers to share their passions with the world! Our goal is to inspire more people to learn how to make things they would normally buy. We're a VC funded company and have raised $7m. We launched in April 2012 and have been featured on CNN, NYTimes, and many more. Design matters strongly to us - to see our work on display checkout our iPhone app (soon an iPad app too). Or, come visit our office in downtown SF. We're housed in a beautiful, large space steps from Yerba Buena park that was formally an art gallery.

##How do people apply?

If you're interested please send an email to careers@snapguide.com. And, thank you for making a difference in the most important campaign I've ever witnessed! Great job, I couldn't be happier with the outcome . :)

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're looking for mobile app developers (iOS and android), front-end developers, server side engineers, interaction designers and visual designers. We're an AWS hosted, python based shop running on the pyramid web framework. We're a small, passionate team eager to give talented people an opportunity to have as big an impact as they can dream.
