##What is great about your company?

- We connect people with local merchants and help local merchants thrive (as opposed to bypassing them like Amzn and Google)

- Flat organization, titles/org chart doesn't matter, almost no bureaucracy  

- Engineering, design and product driven culture, particularly in Palo Alto

- Lots of room to rethink things & improve the app without silly barriers

##How do people apply?

Email me at dstazer@groupon.com, and I'll fast track apps to the recruiters.



If it's posted at http://http://jobs.groupon.com/, you can also apply there, but that goes into a general queue.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

I'm hiring the following:

- Eng Manager (Ruby, Java, MySQL heavy)

- BI/Data Analyst (Lots of SQL, Excel; extra point for Teradata + Microstratergy)

- 2 front end developers (Ruby, MySQL, email templates)

- 1 Mobile developer (iOS + Android)



Also, there are tons of openings in Palo Alto, Chicago and Seattle posted at http://people.groupon.com, and 50+ more engineering/product/design jobs will go up soon
