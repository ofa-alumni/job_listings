##What is great about your company?

EveryBlock is eight people in a loft with a ping pong table on the north side of Chicago, but NBC News Digital pays the bills. You'll be able to have a huge impact on product descisions, but almost entirely insulated from the larger corporation. No 80 hour work-weeks here. We want to be a resource for urban communities. We've already got a lot of traction in Chicago, and we're looking to take it to more cities in the US.

##How do people apply?

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're looking for an iOS developer who can do web stuff, or a web developer who can do iOS. We're primarily a Python/Postgres/Django/Chef shop, but if you've got solid web development skills, we're sure you can pick up Python pretty quickly. Our iPhone app is woefully behind the site, and we want to bring it up to par. We don't have enough bodies to handle it at the moment. That's where you come in.
