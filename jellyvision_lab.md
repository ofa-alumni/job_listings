##What is great about your company?

We make complex and boring information understandable and engaging so that people can learn and make better decisions.  And those people, and the clients who hire us, love us for doing it.  That doesn't suck.  The Jellyvision Lab is a quickly scaling, profitable company that does flash, HTML5, and app development.  People at Jellyvision are uniformly nice, humble, hardworking, ridiculously talented, and hilarious.
