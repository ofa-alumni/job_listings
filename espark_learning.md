##What is great about your company?

eSpark is truly transforming the way kids learn. Many classrooms are still taught in a more or less one-size-fits-all method, where all the kids learn mostly the same things at the same time. Instead, eSpark lets teachers import test scores and put each student on a customized learning path. The personalized curriculum is made up of iPad apps, Youtube videos, and other digital content, delivered through an iPad app in the classroom.



I recently quit Facebook, moved to Chicago, and joined this company as CTO because I am really excited about the personalized learning disruption that is underway in schools. I think eSpark is one of the companies with the greatest chance to really bring it about.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We currently have a very small but rapidly growing engineering team. I am looking to build a locally based, highly effective team of versatile software engineers and designers.



Briefly, here are a few of the jobs:



- Software Engineer. I want a team of engineers that can jump across multiple technologies, from our mobile iOS / Javascript app to a backend made up of Rails and PHP. We place an emphasis on moving very fast, measuring everything, and getting constant feedback to improve our code and processes.



- UI Designer / Student Advocate. We need someone to go to classrooms, sit, watch kids use the app. Talk to teachers. Understand their needs. Then come back, advocate for them, and design the product to accommodate what they want. You'll have fantastic intuition and empathy for teachers and students - ideally, born out of experience teaching or working with schools.



- Data Scientist. We have loads of really interesting data about student growth, achievement, and actual usage of our app in real classrooms. We need someone to help us analyze and make sense of it. You should have mastery of statistics, strong familiarity with some data analysis toolchain (R, etc), and a desire to effect change. This role is really leveraged, with the potential to influence the whole company strategy through effective data.



We are also hiring for a few non-technical roles, including teachers, sales, and interns.
