##What is great about your company?

We help people all over the world dress as well as they've always wanted, with zero shopping required. We do that by giving you your own personal stylist who gets to know you, what you like, and emails through outfits and items they've hand-picked for you. It's completely free and users are going crazy for it.



We're a small, hand-picked team of some of the world's best engineers, designers and product people. Our investors helped build the modern Internet. 



We're all big Obama fans (I personally was there in Grant Park in 2008 when he was first elected!)



We're based in London, so joining us after you finish the campaign is an exciting way to explore the world. San Francisco will always be there when you get back :)



If you want to work with the sharpest, most creative minds in the business then we'd love to chat with you.

##How do people apply?

Feel free to ping me directly (Kieran, Co-Founder/CEO) at kieran@thread.com for an informal chat. Happy to answer any questions and send over more information!

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're growing quickly and are looking for back-end engineers, front-end engineers, data scientists, designers, product managers and general BD hustlers.
