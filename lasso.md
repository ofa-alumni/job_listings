##What is great about your company?

We're working on something exciting. Lasso is the anti-social network—it simplifies the way we connect with the people who matter, our closest friends, in the place that matters, the real world.



Why? We believe there’s a net loss of real-world social interaction due to the pull of the online world and challenges of text/email-based planning. We want to reverse that loss.



We function a bit differently than a typical startup—we're very design-driven and live by the ethos: build a product that has lovers, not users.



We're a young, four-person company and like to have a lot of fun—we're all avid foodies, music fans, and travelers. Together, we've worked in 12 industries, lived on 5 continents, speak 5 languages, a have exactly zero MBAs ; ) We moved to Chicago to participate in Excelerate Labs and love it so far.



##How do people apply?
