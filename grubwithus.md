##What is great about your company?

Imagine a world where you can meet the girl of your dreams, get a job, meet new friends and raise money for a good cause, all from just eating.  That world is Grubwithus and we are hiring!



Getting people to meet over food sounds like an awesome idea and it is, but there are a bunch of problems.  Problems, however, that are solvable with the right team.  To be big, Grubwithus must change the way people view meeting new people and that is what makes our company so great.  We are not afraid to tackle a difficult problem if it means delivering greater happiness and utility to the masses.  



Oh and Harper gave us a shout out on Twitter back in the day when our company got funding!
