##What is great about your company?

We make "TiKL Touch Talk walkie talkie" [1], one of the top social apps on Android. It turns a smartphone into a realtime push-to-talk walkie-talkie. We bootstrapped the company 2 years ago. In 24 months, the user base grew organically from zero to 25 million without any marketing or external investment. The company is profitable in 2011. TiKL has a loyal following, with 240K facebook fans (www.tikl.mobi).



The founder of Y Combinator [2], Paul Graham became very interested in TiKL after we sent him a one-line email "seeking advice". He waived the application and got us into Y Combinator while they turn down 97% of startups that do apply. In Feb 2012, we started seeking angel investing, targeting $1M. Investor interest was overwhelming. A big VC fund jumped in. The seed round actually became Series A equity financing. The VC closed the equity round in 7 days, and took no board seat, setting two unheard-of records among all YC companies. After getting over $2M, we had to shut down the round and said "no, thanks" to a lot of high-profile investors.



As a team of five [3], we are relentlessly and aggressively pursuing our product vision, executing a big plan to grow the user base from 25 million to 250 million in a couple of years. As such, we are creating an all-in-one communication app, named Talkray, that offers texting, calling (including international), conferencing, voice messaging, paging, video on iOS/Android, all for free. It is going to simplify communication for hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses. Please check it out at www.talkray.com.



We are looking for a visual designer passionate about creating beautiful things and intuitive consumer-facing UI.



Thanks,

The TiKL Team



[1] https://market.android.com/apps/SOCIAL?feature=category-nav , click on tab "TOP FREE". It is also available on iOS.

[2] http://ycombinator.com/. The first and most prestigious of all startup incubators. Dropbox and Airbnb, both valued over $1B, came out of YC.

[3] One co-founder was one of the top technical authorities at Motorola, chairing Motorola's patent committee, leading hundreds of engineers around the globe, reporting to the CTO. He quit his Motorola job so he "can write code". The other co-founder was a hands-on leader in Amazon's cloud service (AWS). Three developers joined in Feb, March and June (among 100+ interviewed). The first has been doing iOS development since App Store came about. The second is a star performer from Microsoft Windows kernel team, choosing TiKL instead of Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning's Airtime. The third wrote the #1 Pinterest app on Android before Pinterest shut down 3rd-party API access. We are a team of five where everybody loves coding marathons. :)
