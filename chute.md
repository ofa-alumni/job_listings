##What is great about your company?

Chute helps brands, publishers and developers build photo and video-rich apps with ease and scale.  Through our API, SDK and components, our customers can build new and interesting apps that leverage the explosion of new media from mobile and online services.



We're already helping NBC, CNN and Huffington Post expand their use of media as well as major brands like Chevy, Puma and more.  We're excited to grow our team so we can expand into new opportunities with our customers.



We have been in operation for 2 years, most recently completing Y-Combinator and Turner's Media Camp.  We have closed our seed round of financing, including investments from Freestyle Capital, Salesforce, Battery Ventures, and US Venture Partners.
