##What is great about your company?

Imagine a world where every citizen feels empowered and part of their neighborhood. Imagine if everyone trusted and felt taken care of by their local government. We know there are already a lot of involved citizens and hard-working local authorities and service people. We seek to use the power of the internet to bring them closer together and reach even more people.



At SeeClickFix we help Citizens communicate more efficiently with their Governments and their Neighbors. For Governments we help them manage their external communications. We do this all in a transparent open data manner.



Join us reshaping the public communications channels.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are a growing young company. Our team is dynamic and so are roles and responsibilities. We are currently focused on recruiting a full time mobile developer. However we are always on the look out for strong technical candidates with modern development experience (git, ror, jquery, etc)
