##What is great about your company?

You joined the campaign in part because you want to make a difference - you believe deeply in your ability to make our country a better place. Meetup is changing the world by starting a local community revolution. Our goal is a "Meetup Everywhere about Most Everything", and we're on our way. We help people "use the internet to get off the internet" because Meetups change lives and can change the world.



We are profitable, growing, and committed to building an all-star, all-NYC company. We value doers over talkers and mentors over managers. We are a company where people who take risks and win are rewarded and grow. Everyone on our team has an impact and can see the results of their hard work...that's one of the things that makes Meetup such a special place to be.

##How do people apply?

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Meetup is seeking Product Managers and Product Designers who have an insatiable curiosity about community, with a passion for developing and designing an online experience that supports face-to-face gathering. You'll help build the tools that millions use to strengthen their communities. 



Our development team is smart, ambitious, supportive, and above all - excited by what we do. While meeting regular deadlines and being focused on quick, quality completion of projects, the environment is relaxed and fun.  We are currently seeking Front-End Engineers, Software Engineers, a QA Engineer, a Mobile Web Engineer and a Systems Administrator. 



To keep the Meetup ecosystem humming, we are looking for Community Specialists to respond to mountains of email, hunt down bugs, and serve as advocates for the Meetup community at-large. They help coach and empower our fearless organizers.



Our dream is to change the world, one Meetup at a time. And with our metrics growing faster than they ever have before, we need your help!
