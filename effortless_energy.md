##What is great about your company?

With home energy efficiency, you can actually MAKE money by reducing your carbon footprint rather than spending more.  That means that no matter what the policy environment is, our business model works perfectly and we can keep helping people do the right thing.  Plus, energy efficiency has great side benefits like improving home value, home comfort, and respiratory health, so it pretty much sells itself.  Not to mention the boost it gives us all to energy security, pollution, jobs, and grid stability - clearly home energy efficiency is a worthwhile endeavor!



We're a great company to work at and have a great team to work with because we've got all the facts on our side about why this is an optimal thing to do, a lot of industry experience in the areas you need to be good at in order to solve this problem in an innovative way (e.g. finance, business development, policy, app design, analytics, strategy, operations), and we bring a consumer-friendly perspective to the design of all of our offerings.  We're all passionate about what we're doing - making something that OUGHT to be a no-brainer ACTUALLY a no-brainer!

##How do people apply?

E-mail claire@goeffortless.com with your resume, what interests you about what we're doing, and what about your skills and experiences will help you add value to what we're working on.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're looking for developers for the front-end and back-end, folks with polling and/or market research experience, and also folks with digital and printed communications design experience.  It's a plus if you're interested in energy and climate policy and a double plus if you think energy efficiency is the best idea ever like we do!
