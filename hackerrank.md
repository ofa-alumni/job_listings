##What is great about your company?

-- First Indian company to get funded by Y-combinator. Subsequently setup an office in MountainView



-- Built Interviewstreet which is now being used by some of the biggest companies for hiring (Facebook, NASA, Amazon, Evernote, PocketGems, etc.)



-- Building HackerRank which is much bigger than Interviewstreet, a superset of the company to have the largest community of problem solvers across the globe. 



Imagine if there was a room in SF where the top 5000 brains of the world came to everyday for several hours. The value of that room is incredibly high, and its occupants would have the power to decide the pace of the world and how it should work. We’re building THIS, online. It sounds like a monumental task, because it is, and it is something we’re truly excited and passionate about.
