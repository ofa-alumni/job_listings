##What is great about your company?

At Ginger.io, we believe that big data can revolutionize care. Our platform, which consists of a mobile application that collects active and passive data, our predictive models, and a web dashboard, is a 'check-engine light' for a person's health. Drawing on research from the MIT Media Lab, we use machine learning to model a person's behavior patterns and health - and figure out when something is going wrong. Researchers use our platform to improve their studies, while physicians, hospitals and other healthcare institutions use it to help chronic patients and their caregivers.



As a team, we are all mission-driven, whether that mission is to build the most exciting technology, provide the best customer experience, or fix the broken US healthcare system. We come to work every day energized to solve challenging problems and create change for patients, their loved ones and their care teams. And we strive to make ourselves healthier on Friday evening than when we walk into the office on Monday morning. Whether itâ€™s healthy team meals, walking meetings or fun monthly offsites, we make team well-being a priority.



So, why is Ginger.io great? Big data, better health, and (we believe) the best place to work.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We have opportunities available on both the engineering and business side.



Our engineering team is looking to add a couple of software and/or data engineers who are excited about growing and scaling our systems.  We are also looking for data scientists who can build out the analytics needed to support our platform.



On the business side, we're building out our customer support team, with account managers and community managers who have empathy for both patients and providers.  We're also looking for a senior HR/talent manager.



If none of these seem like a fit but you'd still like to work with us, we are always looking for good people, be they engineers, product managers, marketers, or someone we don't know we need yet!
