##What is great about your company?

Stripe is spreading entirely through word-of-mouth (just search for @stripe on Twitter). It's built for makers, growing at a breakneck pace, and empowers people to create their own businesses. We want to build a fundamental new piece of internet infrastructure.



The team is eclectic and brilliant: https://stripe.com/about.

##How do people apply?

Just drop a note to patrick@stripe.com.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We'll hire almost anyone brilliant, determined, and really pleasant to work with. We especially like people who've previously built significant side-projects or even start-ups.



Particular areas in which we'd love to have more people: engineering, design, data infrastructure, statistics/ML, marketing, compliance, finance, PR, and recruiting.
