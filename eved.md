##What is great about your company?

Our purple walls and lime green conference room! But really, Eved have taken on an incredible challenge of leading the industry transformation from using highly fragmented manual systems to eCommerce. It takes a tremendous amount of innovation, perseverance, hard work and passion to succeed. Our technology approach is unique. Eved is intuitive and simple, resembling the look and feel of familiar consumer sites to make it easy for small businesses to quickly adopt. 



About our company culture: We celebrate even the smallest of things. As a startup tech company, each day marks a new milestone, a first, a best, the most, etc. In the center of the office is a board in which employees pin their accomplishments for that day, even our CEO and President! Publicly recognizing and supporting each other’s hard work is the core of Eved’s Company Culture. Eved fosters a friendly work environment - We have beer in our fridge, celebrate birthdays, enjoy happy hours as a team, company holiday parties, etc.
