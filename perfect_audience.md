##What is great about your company?

We are a small team focused on building products that grow businesses. Our current focus is on sustainable advertising - there are very few forms of advertising that just work without a great deal of input and domain knowledge about the company being advertised. But retargeting - showing ads to customers who left after window shopping a site - just works. We are building the technology and tools to make it easy for anyone to get started and make this work for them.



Here is our launch coverage in TechCrunch: http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/perfect-audience-launch/ 



We are also a small team - 5 in total right now. Our engineering/product team of 3 is based in San Francisco and our Sales/Accounts team of 2 is based in Chicago. We are looking for people to come in and make a big difference for us - owning whole portions of our product. 

##How do people apply?

Reach out to the co-founders, Jordan and Brad at jobs@perfectaudience.com mentioning OFA in the subject and including your resume in the email. We will streamline the application process for all OFA members especially in the leadup to and immediate aftermath of the election. Can't wait to hear from you!

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are always looking for skilled folks of any sort. But we have 3 specific needs at the moment:



Data / Backend Engineer - Currently we have built out our backend optimizing for speed of development. Now we are beginning to review those decisions and either optimize or change based on 



Full-stack Generalist - Our Dev team is currently made of two smart generalists who like to tackle any problem. We are always looking for more folks like this who can come in and apply their skill and intelligence to any situation we throw at them, whether it be messing with our CSS, figuring out our batch processes for data ingestion or optimizing our workflow for end users.



Front-end Developer/ Designer: We are regularly complimented on our UI, but we want to take it further. We have made the most of Twitter bootstrap and built a user experience that is enjoyable and provides easy control and transparency for our customers when looking at the advertising campaigns. We want to move from having great experience to the best, especially as we add features to our product that will invite in entirely new audiences including publishers and bloggers.
