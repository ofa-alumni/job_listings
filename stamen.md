[Stamen is hiring a Senior Backend Developer](http://stamen.com/hiring_senior_backend_developer)
----

“Stamen Design is looking for a world class Senior Backend Developer to join our busy San Francisco design and technology studio.

You will author and support the technical underpinnings of Stamen’s client work. This job touches all aspects of Stamen’s design and technology business, from direct communication with clients to internal support for our creative technologists. The position represents an opportunity to work with a vibrant mapping and data visualization practice that is consistently at the forward edge of technology and culture, and we are looking for someone truly exceptional to support and drive this studio. Read more about this work at [http://sta.mn/4km](sta.mn/4km) and see what we do at [http://stamen.com/](stamen.com).

Primary responsibilities:
----

* Design and support server-side infrastructure for Stamen’s projects, a mix of client-facing, internally-motivated and open source work. You will be responsible for a mix of already existing and new systems, and will have wide latitude in technical design decisions for new projects.
* Maintain our internal infrastructure for development and experimentation on new data projects and client communication tools. Stamen self-hosts blogs and revision control systems for all projects, and supports our work with an in-studio collection of servers and databases.

Requirements:
----

* 5+ years Linux system experience, including shell and command-line text editing, day-to-day maintenance of files and backups, installation of new software including building from source, working with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and familiarity with basic task automation and monitoring. Ubuntu or Debian experience a plus!
* 5+ years programming experience, including 3+ years of Python.
* Understanding of RFC 2616 and other internet-related standards.
* A positive outlook and willingness to try new things with a wide variety of people and clients.

Bonus skills:
----

* Experience with running Amazon Web Services, especially EC2, S3 and Cloudwatch.
* Familiarity with open source geo and image software tools: PostGIS, GDAL, OGR, Mapnik, QGIS, Shapely, PIL, Numpy and others.
* History of contribution to and development for OpenStreetMap, its data and connected technologies.
* Experience with web API’s including classic REST-style service like Flickr’s and newer streaming services like Twitter’s.
* A preference for the new mixed with a toleration for the old: PHP and Subversion are still in active use alongside Python, Node and Git.
* Other open source software experience, including your own projects and some of those found here: [github/stamen](https://github.com/stamen/), [github/citytracking](https://github.com/citytracking/), [github/migurski](https://github.com/migurski/), [github/nvkelso](https://github.com/nvkelso/).

We want to continue to work with positive-thinking, friendly and innovative people who like to work with clients and have this work seen by the public.
----

This is an opportunity to work with a small, seasoned and excitable group that delight in blurring the difference between design and technology. We are responsible corporate citizens, eat lunch together around a big table most days, provide health and retirement benefits and real vacation time, and share profits with all studio members. Our quality of life is important to us and we work hard to create an environment where we can turn personal interest into economically relevant work, and sleep well at night.

We are looking for someone who is: passionate enough to bring their best ideas to work every day and is willing to argue for them, and mature enough to recognize the realities involved in doing paid work for clients. Not everyone can do this; those who can will thrive here.
