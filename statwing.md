##What is great about your company?

First, a quick summary:

Statwing makes data analysis easy. It encodes statistical best practices into software, so nontechnical users can point and click to visualize and understand data like experts. Statwing's primary users to date are marketing managers and analysts, who are dissatisfied with existing tools like SPSS, R, and SAS. 

Statwing is comprised of two Stanford alums. Investors include Y Combinator and Jeff Hammerbacher (Cloudera).



Our mission is to democratize data analysis. Our lives have been enriched immeasurably by the joys and insights of data analysis. We think it's a shame that for the majority of the world struggling along with Excel or barely scratching the surface of tools like SPSS, the state of the art in data analysis hasn't moved in 20 years. So we're making the modern data analysis tool, which we think is a world-changingly important problem to work on.



Check out our demos (on our front page), sign up and upload some data, and if you like it and you're the type of person who might use the word "fun" in conjunction with "data analysis," shoot us an email.

##How do people apply?

Email me at greg@statwing.com with a resume'. Don't sweat a formal cover letter if you don't have one written, maybe just describe a bit in your email how you're down with data analysis.



Cheers!

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're hiring our first employees, who will of course get significant equity. You'll have significant responsibility and freedom to do what you think you need to do to make Statwing better.



Our most pressing need is for a front end engineer, preferably with a good sense of UX and design. We use Backbone, coffeescript, and D3 (for the visualizations).



We're also looking for another back end engineer. We mostly use Clojure, though lack of familiarity with Clojure wouldn't stop us from hiring you.
