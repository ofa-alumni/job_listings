##What is great about your company?

Palantir builds next-generation data analysis software to attack some of the world's hardest, most important data problems.  We've worked on everything from home pricing for underwater homes that leads to mortgage adjustments, locating missing children, various financial anti-fraud workflows, using data on IED attacks to protect the troops overseas, to tracking foodborne illness at the CDC - name a few.



Our work  mix of a deep technical challenges and real-world problem solving.  We are not a consulting company (but we do help our customers use our products) - we just continue to refine our products (which you can think of as fully integrated open source big data stacks tied together with some proprietary technology and a beautiful user interface).  We bring big data capabilities to the people who best understand what the data for any given problem represents: non-programmer subject matter experts.



We're a company of engineers, run by engineers with a fantastic culture and work environment - you can learn at lot more on that score here: https://www.palantir.com/engineering-culture/



##How do people apply?

However, I'd suggest taking the referral approach and emailing me at Ari Gesher <regs@palantir.com> - I'll hand submit the resume with a recommendation.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're hiring in all levels, all departments.  We're looking for people with backgrounds in writing code, software testing, visual design, UX, interface design, project managment/execution, copy writing, IT/operations/infrastructure.  Generally speaking, we look for the sharpest people we can find and then figure out how we can use them.
