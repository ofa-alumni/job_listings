##What is great about your company?

We are trying to build a system that helps people discover the things they love. To make this happen, we're buildling a team of exceptionally talented and diverse people: engineers, designers, statisticians and writers.



What's fun is that right now our team is relatively small - 80 people - but the product is use by millions of people. That means you can own have both a lot of autonomy and a lot of impact.
