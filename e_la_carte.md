##What is great about your company?

E la Carte (www.elacarte.com) is revolutionizing the restaurant industry with our Presto touch-screen tablets, which enable guests to browse appetizing pictures of the entire menu, place orders, split checks, make payments, and play interactive games â€“ all from the comfort of their restaurant seats without having to wait. 



We're not just building an ephemeral website or apps - we're building an actual tablet as a platform and amazing software for restaurants across North America! Your grandmother will use this product.
