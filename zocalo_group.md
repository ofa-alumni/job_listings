##What is great about your company?

Zocalo Group is Omnicom's premier Word of Mouth and Social Media Marketing Agency. We work on helping big brands become the most recommended companies and products in their categories. That's the high level spiel.



I think it's awesome because they bought my startup, Pegmo, and I'm working to help build a kick-ass digital team within the agency to do cool stuff. There's interesting (and sometimes not so interesting) client work... but the really cool stuff is building out a couple internal RoR platforms I've been spearheading. 



So yah. If you want some stability, flexibility, and control after working on the campaign... We should talk. Come learn a shit ton about brands, agencies, and help me build a good team.

##How do people apply?
