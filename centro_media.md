##What is great about your company?

Centro engineers are bringing the advertising industry into the 21st century with great software that streamlines the process of planning, buying, and analyzing digital advertising campaigns. Our software needs to evolve along with an industry that is constantly changing. We strive to provide the best user experience possible -- we want our customers to love our platform not only because of everything it can do, but also how enjoyable it is to do it.



Our new flagship product is a Rails 3 app, and we're constantly exploring new front and back-end technologies to see how we can further improve things. And we're just getting started. We've always built great software to support Centro's great services, but now we're setting out to make Centro a great software company.



So that's what we're doing, but I'd also like to tell you what makes working in our software division the best job I've ever had:



**Amazing people.** We hire carefully. We don't fill seats. Our interview process for developers involves pair programming with a few team members so we get a feel for how you work with us and how we work with you. We've found this results in a cohesive team of people who enjoy each others' company and work well together.



**Your time is valuable.** Meetings are kept to a minimum. We do a stand-up meeting in the morning and then people are free to work where and how they choose. Need some time to yourself to think through a tough problem? Then work at home. Need an extra set of eyes? Pair up. We trust our developers to do the right thing.



**Self-improvement is part of your job.** Generous training and conference budgets help you develop your skills and increase your value to the company. Friday 20% time gives you the freedom to solve problems we might not have thought of yet or work on projects that scratch your own itch. Our production iOS app started as a 20% project and turned into a key part of our platform. Developers are using tools like R and Ember.js to see where we can take our data and software next. One of my teammates integrated a city traffic light with our build server using an Arduino.



**Integrated teams.** The product team, interaction designers and developers all work together. If you have a suggestion that can improve a design, we are all ears. The goal is to make great software, not to adhere to a process.



A personal note: I've been at Centro for nearly 5 years, working from a mid-level web developer up to a team lead with some of the most talented folks I've ever worked with reporting to me. I come to work every day excited to see my team and build software with them. If you have questions please feel free to get in touch with me directly at josh@stringbot.com or via Twitter: @stringbot
