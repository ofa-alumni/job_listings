##What is great about your company?

With well over a century of Pixar, Apple, Disney, and Skywalker Sound roots, we decided that it was time for kids to talk to the toys that they already own, and time for their toys to talk back.  So we're turning your iPad into a magic mirror that enables two way, verbal conversation. Think ToyStory, in your lap, in your hands, in your house.  For real.

Like the 20 years I personally spent at Pixar (most recently as CTO), we play at the intersection of nearly impossible technical challenges and absolutely world class creative content. So if you enjoy working at place where technical and creative people interact, challenge, and inspire each other on an ongoing, daily basis, drop us a line. We should talk.



Note, we expect to launch our first product in the market this winter, so you'll be joining a (well funded) startup pre-product launch. Inventing, creating, delivering, and monetizing a new form of media (synthetic conversation) is not an easy, nor a short, ride. Therefore equity grants, and the ability to influence the final product in very significant ways, come along with this ride, as does all the risk associated with that. Put on your helmets and wear your seatbelts.

##How do people apply?

Check out our website and apply through the page there.  Or you can always just email me directly, but if you do that, please mention in your email that you heard about ToyTalk through this GoogleDoc.



Looking forward to hearing from you all,

Oren Jacob

PS: We are very family-friendly, dog-loving, and aggressively snowsports-forward. Squaw Valley opens this weekend, and I'm taking my 3 kids up to ride, so if you email me on a weekend I'll probably get back to you Monday morning.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Lots of things from front end web engineer (full stack) to deep AI and NLP to speech synthesis, speech recognition, computer vision and game design. We play mostly in python, C++, ObjC and iOS.



Also if you're gifted at online social community engagement and/or management, have a legit creative writing portfolio, graphic design, illustration, or animation background, please get in touch.



A special shout out to people who can help drive growth in viral, paid, earned, or other channels.



We just closed a big round of financing a few days ago (see TechCrunch, VentureBeat, GigaOM, PandoDaily, Bloomberg, etc.. for coverage) so if you think you can help us, please apply and let's see if there's a fit.
