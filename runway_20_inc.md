##What is great about your company?

The people is what is great about our company. We work hard and enjoy learning from one another. The team is the company's most valuable asset and we are looking for great people to join us.

We're building predictive intelligence into your smartphone. 



We provide users just the information they need right as they need it and simplify task completion on the iPhone. 



From telling you 20 minutes before you leave for work that there is a major accident on your typical route, to booking you a flight to NYC like a real personal assistant, weâ€™re building an app to simplify your life.



We are working on information retrieval, machine learning and making sense of the common patterns and key places in our users lives. The user models we build help us make predictions and determine what information to present and when.



Smartphones are going to be the primary mode of computing and as such we have direct access to people all the time. It is really only in the past year that what we are doing has become possible on a large scale. This is largely because background location is available and hence we are able to build models of the user and importantly tie key bits of information to the user's current state (think position). As smartphone adoption continues to grow with smartphones outshipping PCs for over a year, and as these phones continue to improve we will have more trigger points to present our users with relevant information, simplified task completion and ultimately commerce opportunities.



The potential here is enormous. Once on a user's phone, we have the opportunity to become a key aspect of their everyday life -- letting the user focus on what's important to them and in many ways delivering simplicity to their life. Within the information we provide is how we will make money -- as we provide contextual information to the user, we can layer in the products or services they need. For example, if we see a user has a flight tomorrow, we could offer long term parking or a car service. The end game here is to provide a platform of trigger points and quality controls that enable us to significantly increase the reach of what we are doing.



We are a team of four from Google, Berkeley, MIT and Nokia Research. We are looking for great people that are passionate about what we are building and the technology behind it.
