##What is great about your company?

You’ve changed the world with the Obama Campaign. Now you can continue to change the world at Facebook, with challenges that you will not find anywhere else. We have a billion users but the challenge is the next 6 billion. 



We don’t have rules. We have values. We want people who can solve challenging problems, make a real impact and build something big. We focus on impact, finding and solving the biggest and most important problems. Our teams are challenged every day to “Be Bold” and we have a saying “The riskiest thing is to take no risks.” In a world that’s changing so quickly, you’re guaranteed to fail if you don’t take any risks.



We believe that a more open world is a better world and that Facebook was created to make the world more open and connected, not just to build a company. We expect everyone at Facebook to focus every day on how to build real value for the world in everything they do.



You should join us.
