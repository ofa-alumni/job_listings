##What is great about your company?

Brilliant is building a high-quality online problem solving program in math and science for gifted youth around the world. We believe that having access to an intellectually challenging environment allows students to engage with the world in a more thoughtful way than they would otherwise, and are frustrated that such opportunities are not available to more students outside of privileged settings. Brilliant aims to democratize how smart, driven students are identified and developed. You can read more about our investors and our company in this recent BusinessWeek article: buswk.co/PXhNAT
