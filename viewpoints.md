##What is great about your company?

Launching a new project within the existing Viewpoints network, we are empowering business owners to collect, analyze and publish feedback from their customers.  Our tools employ natural language generation, geo location, structured data, contextual relevance and cloud deployed technology.  We strive to make this simple, elegant and accessible.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are hiring a talented Ruby on Rails software craftsman to

join our product team in Chicago.



Are you into building freely available tools, designed to be used by millions of businesses?  Do you think mobile first, and are focused on the confluence of social, local and mobile (SoLoMo- a ridiculous term... we know) but it is a fantastic growing and thriving marketplace. 



At Viewpoints you'll be part of a small, nimble team in which every member has a seat at the table. You'll get to iterate on product design before you write a single line of code and passionately debate the finer points of user experience. We've developed an exciting

business plan for a growing market with plenty of room for disruption, but we need your passion and talent to make it work. Lunchpail programmers need not apply.



About the technology



We develop using Ruby on Rails 3.2, MySQL, Unicorn, nginx, git, Solr, Redis, HTML5, CSS3/SASS, jQuery, Modernizr and responsive design. We practice agile, test-driven development and deploy our own code at least biweekly.



About the position



Talent, fit and passion are as important as experience.  We are working to crack a big, hard-to-solve market problem. Your role will be to work closely with our product team to invent and hand-code new features; evolve our application architecture; help manage our server and cloud infrastructure; and monitor our uptime, scalability and

performance.
