##What is great about your company?

We're a fun, small, bootstrapped software company.



Here are some of the people you'd work with: https://vimeo.com/figure53/review/29494810/100a8037cc  (NOTE: This video is a bit out of date; there are more of us now.)



We build industry-changing tools for artists.



We Know Our Sh*t in OS X, iOS, and on the web.



Products! Cool products! Cool products that have been heard by billions of people!



Our stuff drives almost every show on Broadway. Also: Blue Man Group, Cruise Ships, Olympic events, etc.



We have seriously kick-ass customers; people who provide extraordinary feedback and care about our work. We get software love letters: http://figure53.com/qlab/quotes/



We have an open and flat company culture.



We have (very) flexible schedules.



We have a cool office that we hack on for fun.  (e.g. Building custom software to project videos on our staircase.)



We don't travel for work. (Except for occasional company meet-ups when everyone gets together for hacking and fun and brainstorming.)



We cover 100% of the best BlueCross PPO health plan.



Everyone gets a company credit card, and discretion to use it as they feel is appropriate.



Company lunch every Monday & Friday (As described in our employee-written company handbook: http://figure53.com/handbook/ )

##How do people apply?

Email me! Let's chat!

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

I like to hire people for two reasons:



1) Based on the skills we need, or



2) Based on an extremely talented person wanting to work with us.



Right now, (1) means I'm interested in designers* and web developers.



(2) means I'm interested in you, if you're great at what you do and excited by what we do.



*DEAR DESIGNERS: If you LOVE PIXELS and obsess over them and your masterwork has or will some day take the form of a gorgeous user interface I would especially love to talk to you. Come, let us meld our talents into a white-hot design/engineering amalgam of stunning subtlety and refinement. You wanna own the design of a small company? You wanna help make us the Panic of the east coast?  Then you wanna email me.

##Campaign people who have had experience with company:

*(Please add yourself if you know anything about this organization)*

* [Jesse Kriss](mailto:jesse@jklabs.net) This is where I worked immediately before the campaign. I also helped create the very first version of [QLab with Chris back in 2004](http://chrisashworth.org/blog/2010/02/19/the-illustrated-history-of-qlab-personal-milestone-edition/). This is a great company, with great people. Fun fact: Chris also made [Slow Clap for Congress](http://chrisashworth.org/blog/2011/09/01/slow-clap-for-congress/).
