##What is great about your company?

At Flutter, we've started a gesture revolution and are making gesture based interaction a reality.  We detect gestures via webcam and allow you to use those to control iTunes & Spotify.  You can get early preview of our latest version @ http://flutterapp.com/next.



We've solved # of interesting problems to make our app very simple.  In addition, we are going to dabble into facial gestures algorithms and are in process of building gesture based HCI vocabulary - and we're just getting started on these challenges.



We are still a small team with, 4 PhDs in computer vision (from MIT Media Lab, Washington, Oxford, etc.), a kick-ass designer, few other interns, and product/hustler. Navneet - ceo & co-founder of Flutter - is essentially Tom Brady of computer vision - his PhD thesis in computer vision improved state of the art in image detection by 1000x.  He has 4000+ citations on this and HOG filter is now part of core CV curriculum.  We are also backed by great investors such as NEA, A16z, and Y combinator.



Two things we can guarantee is that you will be challenged at Flutter lot more than pretty much any other place, and you will be doing some of the most amazing work of your life.  We are a very unique start-up in the sense that we live at intersection of original research, ingenious engineering, and intuitive design.  If you're average of 5 smartest people around you, then our team has lot to offer.  [Even our website shows the unique take we're taking on things!]  



As Peter Thiel says, we're dealing with 0-1 problem... something that have never been done before and make it ubiquitous.  Accordingly to him, these are usually the start-ups that you learn the most at regardless of the outcomes.



Lastly, we're still small enough where you have opportunity to be part of small core team that drives this company & vision forward and make revolutionary impact!
