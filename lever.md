##What is great about your company?

Lever is redefining talent software, starting with applicant tracking for hiring. With Lever, we aim to set the standard for next generation web apps, and we are hiring software engineers and designers who share our ambitions.



After interviewing managers at Square, Twitter, Yammer, AirBnB, Stripe, and other great companies, we learned that applicant tracking tools are ripe for disruption. Limited visibility into hiring data frustrates engineering managers trying to grow their teams, and difficult to use tools frustrate interviewers and recruiters alike. This is a unique opportunity where companies are already eager to adopt new enterprise software.



Lever’s culture is rooted in pairing technology innovation with user-driven design. We work right next to 50 of our users, directly learning how we can make each of their days a little better with every code push. Rather than defining our product by a list of features, we have reimagined applicant tracking around the candidate-company relationship.



We are located in our pilot customer’s office in San Francisco. In addition to the best user feedback a team could ask for, we also get three free meals a day, free snacks, an office full of talented engineers and designers to learn from, and a spectacular roof deck.
