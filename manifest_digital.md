##What is great about your company?

Manifest is a unique blend of talent, leadership and creativity.  We are well-organized and focused on business results, with a passion for cutting-edge design.  Above all, we are human beings. Who love to have fun… learn… do great work… do good deeds. And we prefer to mix all that together whenever possible.  If you like, we can also tell you about ourselves through our official boilerplate:

 

“Manifest is an interactive agency with a unique ability to spark lively conversation, connection and exchange. Our perspective is honest and unbiased, helping people and brands connect in more meaningful ways. We do this by uncovering powerful insights that help us create award‐winning websites, mobile applications, online ad campaigns, events and brand experiences.”

 

Let’s put a few numbers behind that: We’re the largest independent interactive agency based in the Midwest. We were founded in 2001. We have over 100 team members working with clients around the world.  Our services range from strategies in experience design, content development, marketing plans, visual design, website development, interactive applications, mobile, social, and more.  And when we’re not in the office, you’ll find us at a recent gallery opening, curled up with the new George R.R. Martin novel, or performing onstage at the Metro. 

 

If you want to hang a tag on us, wrap it up in a bow, you could say that we are the creative and technical equivalent of an agency for the 21st century: what we call an interactive consultancy.  Or, the best answer for a world utterly transformed by Digital.
