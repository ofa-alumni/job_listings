##What is great about your company?

Steve Jobs described education as one of the final frontiers still untouched by modern technology. Clever is building the data platform for great software to make its way into the classroom. Just like Stripe has made it simple for developers to build payment processing into their apps, Clever has made it easy for developers to build applications for schools using student data.



We're a small team of highly technical hackers with deep experience in education. Since releasing the Clever APIs in June, we've signed up the most innovative education companies as partners and deployed our platform to over 1,800 schools. Clever moves data for over 500,000 students every day, and that number is growing rapidly.

##How do people apply?

To apply, email us at jobs+n@getclever.com, where n is the number of students in the Clever sandbox API data set with a last name that begins with the letter 'V'.



Send us one or more things from [resume, github profile, recent side projects, linkedin URL, Stack Overflow profile, etc], and let us know how you solved our 'puzzle.'
