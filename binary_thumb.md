##What is great about your company?

Grid is a post-pc creation tool for the iPad. I believe that the word document and the spreadsheet began the computing revolution in the 80s, and the same thing is happening again in the mobile world, however their is no true successor to these pivotal pieces of software.



It's easy to judge a spreadsheet by it's artifacts: budgets, financial projections, software for accountants. However what it actually became was digital graph-paper for people, that allowed them to pour and organize their mind on something that paper could never accomplish.
