##What is great about your company?

Practice Fusion is the industry-leading free, web-based EHR for physicians to manage their practices and PHR (Patient Fusion) for patients to manage their health.  We are leading the charge in revolutionizing physician-patient relationships for the digital age.  We're 220 people strong, with 95 in Engineering, TechOps, DevOps, Product, Design, and UX.  Thanks to the President's leadership with the HITECH aspect of the Stimulus Bill, the Electronic Health Records industry is flourishing.  We're providing all the tools the next generation of digital doctors will need to keep their patients healthy and out of the hospital.
