##What is great about your company?

For 15 years, Cooper has been designing successful digital products by focusing on human goals. We've designed our company the same way.



We hire stars, then make sure they're set up for success. We plan our projects for a 40-hour work week. We don't think chaos is a necessary ingredient for creativity. We believe in coaching, clear career paths, and a workplace that's as much a community as it is a company.



We work with clients large and small all over the world. Our projects include everything from complex financial, analytical, and enterprise applications to medical devices, Web applications, and car dashboards. In a single year, a Cooper designer might work on a securities trading application, a surgical tool, and a revolutionary new phone.
