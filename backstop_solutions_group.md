##What is great about your company?

Backstop is a Chicago company that makes web-based software applications for hedge funds and the people who invest in them. Wait, "hedge funds" -- sounds like we are pitching to the wrong campaign, right? To us, they're just customers. Most of us have at least a mild interest in finance, but at the end of the day we care about writing systems that would be great in any domain.



We take an Agile approach to software development, embrace open-source solutions, and work with the latest technology whenever we can. Over the last few years, we have grown considerably, won several awards, and built a lot of great software. Backstoppers take our customers and our service very seriously but pride ourselves on not taking ourselves too seriously in the process.
