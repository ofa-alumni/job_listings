##What is great about your company?

What would the Mac OS Finder look like if it were invented today, rather than in 1983? Collections is a personal content manager built for the age of cloud computing. In addition to your local files, it gives you access to all of the important digital content you have stored in cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive and in web apps like Facebook and Instagram. As a universal finder for the cloud, you can take back control of all of the content you care about. Our first client is a native Mac app to be released this November, but we also intend to support Windows, tablets, and mobile. Recently out of the summer 2012 batch of Y Combinator, we're a scrappy team of four living and working out of a house in Mountain View. If you find this intriguing please get in touch!

##How do people apply?

Just shoot an email to Jordan, who did a brief stint on OFA's 08 new media team, with a bit about yourself and some examples of your work. jordan@collections.me

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're always looking for more Mac and iOS/Android developers, but we're extremely impressed by OFA's evident design chops, so we'd welcome interest from skilled frontend designers/engineers.
