##What is great about your company?

PagerDuty is a startup that makes a tool relied on by thousands of organizations, including the Obama campaign, Heroku, Dropbox, Airbnb, Linode, 37signals, Adobe, and Reuters.  PagerDuty is an alerting and incident tracking system that helps engineers solve critical issues with their IT infrastructure as quickly as possible.  We collect alerts from all of your IT monitoring tools and alert the on-duty engineer if there's a problem. Alerts are dispatched via automated phone call, SMS or email. PagerDuty also schedules on-call duty for your teams and ensures no failures ever go unnoticed by automatically escalating unanswered alerts to another team member.
