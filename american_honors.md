##What is great about your company?

We’re young, nimble, and laser focused on changing the higher education space to make it more accessible and cost-effective for all families. Our product and engineering team is tasked with a big responsibility to create the best online learning and student services platform available. That means we get to play around and leverage some fairly cool technologies (Ruby, Rails, MongoDB, Redis, Node, Backbone, etc). 



The higher education space is broken and we think that a large part of the solution will be solved by technology. We face many challenges that require “out of the box” thinking. We’re introducing our partners to the 21st century by bringing group video chat to the once static online classes, building collaborative curriculum development tools for instructors to create top-notch courses across the country, and taking boat loads of data and synthesizing it for easy consumption to increase the efficiency of student advising.



These are just a few of our challenges that keep us busy. When we’re not busy delivering code, we are typically: whiteboarding, planning happy hours, and building company leaderboards. We have a great group of advisors and big investors, real students and faculty using the platform, and we're ready to go full steam ahead into next year. Oh yeah, and the people that work here aren’t too bad either. :)
