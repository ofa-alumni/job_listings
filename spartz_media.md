##What is great about your company?

We're one of the best places to work in Chicago

Your work will be seen and used by millions of people. We don’t have any external forces ruling us, so we’re driven by our own motivation to build something amazing & impact the world.

Do what you’re best at. First, we’ll work with you to determine your strengths. Then we’ll make sure you’re spending most of your time on activities that complement your strengths.

Work with people who inspire you to be better. We are as selective as the top tech companies - we often receive hundreds of applications before we fill a position. We believe if your teammates don’t bring out the best in you, you’re probably on the wrong team.

Everyone contributes ideas. Regardless of what department you’re in, it’s part of your job. We’re helping to write the rules of a blindingly fast-paced industry and innovation is the lifeblood of our business. Ideas are celebrated and innovation is everyone’s job here. We believe there’s a better way to do everything.

Do what you love to do. You spend most of your waking life at work. It is vital that you do something that enhances yourself, and society, on a higher level. We’ll do whatever we can to match your tasks to your interests.

We’re committed to helping you reach your potential. Personal and professional development is a top priority. And we put our money where our mouth is - you’ll have an unlimited budget to spend on learning materials.

The entire process is run by developers.  We use a modified process that focuses on working software, constant communication and visualization of current priorities.

Full list of reasons to work at Spartz Media.

 

The office environment is fun and energetic. We have napping couches, unlimited free food/drinks (soda, coffee, tea, waffles, cereal, milk, pop, candy, chips), an incredibly popular darts league, and we're in the process of constructing a replica of the Chicago skyline out of energy drink cans. As you can see, Spartz Media is a serious company run by serious people.

We're looking for full-time individual applicants in the Chicago area to work in our downtown office.
