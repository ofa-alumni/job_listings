##What is great about your company?

Cue churns your all of your information online in to an intelligent overview of your day.



We're tackling immense engineering challenges. For example, out of an email from American Airlines we'll pluck the the confirmation number out. When you get an evite invitation, we'll grab the address. At peak load, we'll handle 1.5B (billion!) documents a day - processing them, semantically analyzing them and figuring out what are the actionable bits of information users might need. 



By the time you finished reading this paragraph, we've probably done this process over 100,000 times.

##How do people apply?

Send us an email at jobs+XWNWYGKXWIW@cueup.com. 

Include a resume, but more importantly a github profile if you have one.



(bonus points of if you figure out what that address means!)

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

2 types of positions:



We're looking for engineers that are motivated by solving hard problems that haven't really been solved before.



We're also on the lookout for project managers that are capable of organizing with a technical team and product designers.
