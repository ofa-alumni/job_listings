##What is great about your company?

The purpose, the people and the progress. 



Purpose: When people think of market research, they usually associate it with being painstaking, expensive, and complicated. At Lab42, we take a high tech, modern approach while providing a high touch experience. We are endlessly committed to making market research accessible and painless for our clients, while being fun and interactive for our respondents. Our product innovation is driven by tackling what sucks about market research.



People: We are a team of 8 with breadth of experience to the table, from market research to advertising to public relations to startups. We have built a sense of belonging and ownership--Lab42 feels uniquely ours. 



Progress: For being barely two years old, we have a pretty badass list of clients. For example: IDEO, Pepsi, Ogilvy, Y&R, GREE, Target, Walgreens etc.
