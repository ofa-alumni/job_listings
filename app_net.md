##What is great about your company?

We are doing some fundamental work in open platforms/APIs. You can read about some of the possibilities of the platform here: http://tidbits.com/article/13216 



During the summer our grassroots funding campaign was successful and attracted a great deal of attention.



We also have had some involvement from the Obama Campaign, I have seen a few staffers using App.net as well as this official account:

##How do people apply?

Please email jobs@app.net

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are looking for 1-2 _engineers_ who are comfortable working on the fiddly aspects of a website that does billing like App.net. Experience doing optimization work on signup funnels, email, etc is important. I am guessing there are quite a few folks in the campaign that are experts doing this kind of work.



##Campaign people who have had experience with company:
