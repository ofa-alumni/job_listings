##What is great about your company?

Dev Bootcamp (http://devbootcamp.com) is a 9-week developer training program that takes students from no programming experience to being hirable as a junior-level developer.



What's that, you say?  IT CAN'T BE DONE?!?



We're in the middle of our third cohort.  This last summer we graduated 48 students and placed 95% of the students looking for a job with a median salary of $85k.  Students went to work for companies like Pivotal Labs, ThoughtBot, Twitter, and Hipmunk.



This is the only job I've had where the customers -- our students -- work harder than the staff does!  It's absolutely inspiring and humbling to be entrusted with changing their lives for the better.  Our students tell us this is the most profound, life-changing educational experience they've ever had.



We need engineers who love to teach, and want to spent their time building the classroom experience they always wish they had.



I went to school at the University of Chicago, so Obama has now been my state representative, Senator, and President.  I worked on the campaign in 2008.



I also grew up in rural Michigan.  Along with my co-founder Shereef, I decided to create the kind of educational experience I wish I had growing up.



When Obama talks about how we need to "create the jobs of the future" or "retrain America," people ask "How?"  Dev Bootcamp is one possible answer.



If you love programming, love teaching, and love changing the world you should join us.  This is the first job I've had where I get to exercise the entrepreneur, teacher, and software engineer living inside me -- all at once.

##How do people apply?

Email me (jesse@devbootcamp.com) explaining why they're excited!  Tell me a story about your most memorable educational experience -- that teacher who changed your life, that friend you helped you through, etc. -- and include a resume.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're hiring engineers and designers to help work on our internal, real-time classroom software.  You'll work hands on with the students.  If you're used to working on products where your customers are far away and you only interact with them through software, this will blow your mind.



The speed of product learning is faster here than anywhere I've worked.



We're also looking for a Developer Evangelist to be our public face, both online and offline.  They'd be responsible for organizing the alumni community -- now about 120 students -- and interacting with online communities of aspiring programmers on behalf of DBC.
