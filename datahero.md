##What is great about your company?

We are taking a novel approach to enable users of any ability to quickly and easily understand the data that matters most to them.  Like the Obama campaign, we probably share many interests in terms of good analytics and the importance of design.  With Datahero, users can import their data and create visualizations in minutes using only a web browser, with no IT and no data expert needed. 



We're a well-funded early stage start-up looking for hardworking and talented people to join us and help change the way people think about data. We are heavily influenced by user- centric product design and see ourselves at the intersection of design and data. As an early team member, youâ€™ll gain invaluable experience helping us develop our product and build the company from the early days. Our goal is to enable anyone to understand the data that matters most to them, and we want your help!
