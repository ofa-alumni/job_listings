##What is great about your company?

Our 90% share of the vehicle navigation market gives us resources to do other things that we know are extremely important even if they lack a clear path to revenue.  



Example: 



-Trapster is an app that is available on IOS, Android, Blackberry, mobile web (HTML5), etc.  It has 15M users and is growing rapidly.  We run it like a stand-alone start-up that has the resources of a big company.



We also learn a great deal from our new customers that essentially compete with our parent company such as Amazon and some really exciting players that we cannot announce yet. 



From a personal growth perspective we are global so there are opportunities to start out in Chicago and end up in Europe, Africa, Asia, etc.   Personally I have worked in 12 countries while keeping Chicago as my home base.  This is something that I never imagined that I would do and it has been thrilling - especially at times when I was a little burnt out on business.



We also have great benefits including a private gym, matching 401K, a discounted stock purchase plan, etc. 



Also we are at the really interesting intersection of local, mobile and social and our apps (Nav, Augmented Reality, Transit, etc) are getting fantastic net promoter scores.



As Apple has reminded the world the challenges related to mobile mapping are quite significant and the domain expertise that you would pick up here would likely create a lot of additional opportunities for you going forward. 



Finally, it is a really fun place to work.  I was an entrepreneur prior to joining the company and I told my wife I would give her a 2 yr break from the emotional roller coaster and instability of start-up life.  8 yrs later I am still here and working on really interesting problems that, when solved, have really positive societal impact. 

 

##How do people apply?

I recommend four things:



1) apply here if you find a job that interests you: https://navteq.taleo.net/careersection/01/moresearch.ftl?lang=en



2) send your resume to me once you have applied: ivan.sheldon@nokia.com  (I cannot promise that I will respond to every e-mail but I probably can forward your into directly to the hiring manager. 



3) if you do not find something that you like send me your resume and I will keep my eyes/ears open to try to find something for you



4) feel free to connect with me via Linked-In: ivan.sheldon@nokia.com



Good luck in both the election and what follows!



Ivan
