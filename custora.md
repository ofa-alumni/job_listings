##What is great about your company?

We're delivering some of the most sophisticated customer analytics in the world to retailers large and small, and enabling them to easily act on what the find.  Since we're still very lean (5 people), you will have a very meaningful impact on the companies future.



We help retailers earn more from happier customers.



To be a little more specific, we can point to a single retail customer and paint a meaningful portrait with her data: How much sheâ€™ll spend, how often she'll make purchases, what types of products she's inclined to buy, her predicted likelihood of returning, and more. Custora also integrates with email marketing providers and customer support systems to fuel a seamless, iterative flow of insights to actions.
