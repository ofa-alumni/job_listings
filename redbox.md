##What is great about your company?

OUR TECHNOLOGY ISN’T ONLY PRACTICAL.

IT’S PRACTICALLY INCOMPARABLE.



The technology at Redbox would be blazing new industry trails if we weren’t responsible for the trails to begin with. Few companies do what we do, and even fewer are applying technology in paradigm-shifting ways. Through continual innovation, our nimble teams are opening the door to pioneering ventures in automated retail, including ticketing services for live events, with a number of  others in queue. 



Consider our scope for a moment: over 42,000 kiosks in over 34,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada; nearly 2 million rentals daily; and more than 2 billion rentals to date. Now consider the robotics, analytics, and algorithms that sit behind all of this – that make this stuff happen in ways that are not only seamless, but tailored to our customers’ unique profiles. 



And perhaps the most impressive number of all: a ranking of #15 on Fortune’s list of “Fastest Growing Companies” in 2012—up seven slots from our #22 ranking in 2011. 



For all of this to cohere in a meaningful way, our technology and our talent have to play nicely together. We work in tight-knit teams that share expertise in ways that raise everyone’s game and result in killer releases that perform. We apply a relentless curiosity that provides more than solutions – it sparks the energy that drives innovation.



So that’s a bit about our environment, what we do, and how we do it. Now here’s a glimpse into what type of technologies/environments we’re running:



-	MS Azure

-	Agile development using tools such as C#, .NET 4.0, Web Services, XML, SQL Server, MSMQ, JavaScript, and MVC.

-	Object-oriented design and programming.

-	Web and Windows applications.

-	XP practices.

-	PowerShell, NUnit, ORM, and CruiseControl.

-	SoapUI and QTP.



If you want to see what you’ve created on a massive scale; if you want learn and share expertise alongside crazy-smart and talented colleagues; if you want to have a direct hand in the future of a business; if you want all this in an environment where flipping out over Comic-Con won’t land you in a corner with an ill-fitting, pointy hat – we’d encourage you explore our career opportunities.



We believe diversity and inclusion create organizational strength: EOE M/F/D/V
