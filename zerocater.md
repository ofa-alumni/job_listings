##What is great about your company?

We're that rare startup that's actually got a product that makes money AND does good things for the world. We help offices set up great lunches from local chefs, pop-up kitchens, and restaurants trying to get off the ground. We help these local small businesses get going with steady business while also bringing people together over food - it's pretty cool.



We emphasize a good workplace culture over pretty much everything else, and it has worked well for us - we have 25 people now who are all great friends and love to work hard together. Our engineering culture emphasizes independence and control, good design, and fast iteration. We've got 3 engineers but plan on doubling that number and adding a UX designer, as we're making a big push to expand our product in new ways that you could help us build from scratch.



Since we've already got a proven business model, we can offer a highly competitive salary and great benefits. Plus, you'll get free lunch every day :)

##How do people apply?

Head over to our jobs page to get a little more detail on our positions. Then, send an email to s@zerocater.com with some background on yourself and show us something you made.

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

Web developers - We work with Django and have a sizable javascript application written with backbone. We don't think it's too important what technologies you use, since good developers can learn new stuff fast. More important is that you're smart and get stuff done.



UX design lead - we've got one of those interfaces which has been made by pure engineers. We need someone with vision to come in, take charge, and help us make something great.
