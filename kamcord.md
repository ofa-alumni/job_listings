##What is great about your company?

We love to laugh while working hard :)



We're 3 MIT hackers building a new way for mobile games to be distributed. We allow users to record and share a video of their awesome mobile gaming moments. This enables games to be spread through word-of-mouth as opposed to incentivizing people to download games or boring banner ads.

##How do people apply?

You can email me, Matt Zitzmann, here: matt@kamcord.com



Thanks! :)

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We're looking for software engineers and help with sales/marketing/BD.



On the engineering front, we'd like to find a generalist. If you have iOS experience, great! If not, no worries :)



On the sales/marketing/BD front, we're looking for a very motivated person that can get deals closed.
