##What is great about your company?

We are awesome because we help save lives.  We also like burritos. 



We give people online fundraising pages to raise money for a loved one's out-of-pocket medical expenses.  We've helped 20,000+ families raise nearly $25 million for things like cancer treatments, organ transplants and even groceries and travel expenses to and from treatment when a loved one is sick.



We were named best consumer startup in Chicago in 2012 and also best social innovation in the country for 2012 by the Edison Gold Awards.

##How do people apply?

Designer position - send resume and a paragraph about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit with our culture to Joe Kim Joe@GiveForward.com



Brand Evangelism Program Director - send resume and a paragraph about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit with our culture to Ethan Austin ethan@GiveForward.com

##What kind of opportunities are available at your organization?

We are looking for a designer who can realize designs as HTML, as opposed to Photoshop PSDs.  And when design needs are light, he/she can work on front end development work.  



In a non-tech related role, we are also looking for someone to lead a GiveForward brand evangelism program.



This is a new role we are creating and probably one of the most critical roles we need to fill for long-term succes. The idea is to create a powerful volunteer program to help us better leverage the thousands of former users who are fans of GiveForward and now want to volunteer and spread the word for us.  The person leading this program would essentially be running our entire ground game.  We would love to talk to the field directors as their skills would transfer perfectly for this position.
