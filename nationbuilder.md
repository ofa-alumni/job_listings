##What is great about your company?

NationBuilder is the world's first community organizing system, bringing together social media, voter data, online donations, field tools, a people database and an easy-to-use website all in one affordable package. It’s the tool that every organizer wants and wishes they’d had years ago. NationBuilder is bringing organizing not just to every political candidate from school board to Senate, but to authors, filmmakers, and anyone building a community around what they do. Backed by top folks in Silicon Valley like Andreesen Horowitz, Sean Parker, and Chris Hughes, the Los Angeles-based company has grown to 1500 customers in just a year.
