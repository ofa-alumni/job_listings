##What is great about your company?

Biznass bit: Belly is a universal loyalty platform which installs customer facing iPads and proprietary software in small businesses. Users can accrue points via a check-in on the iPad at their favorite businesses using mobile applications or with a physical BellyCard. In May 2012, Belly raised 10 million from Andreessen Horowitz.  Andreessen Horowitz is the best technology VC firm in the world, this is the only early stage fundraising they have ever done in the Midwest. 



Tech/Product bit: Belly is a technology and product driven company, we believe in developing world class products through beautiful design, user experiences and carefully written code. We care about quality, we write tests, we donâ€™t have egos.  We collaborate on problems, we deploy code continuously and we build products around our platform.  



Our iPad merchant app is written in JavaScript with a native Objective-C wrapper.  This infrastructure enables us to automatically deploy new versions across our network of over 3000 merchants.  Every iPad heartbeats home each minute, it sends back usage and diagnostic data to the API and the API responds with version information.  iPads download new assets from the server and update their code in real time - simultaneous versions can run on each iPad and all analytics data is segmented accordingly.  We can run real time A/B tests across the network, deploy features daily and remotely triage problems.



Our API is written in Rails, backed by MySQL and MongoDB.  We host in amazon EC2, with replication and redundancy.



We have several products, including our website, native mobile apps and facebook integration.  But we have focus.  We build products that are core to our vision of enabling small businesses.



We are 15 months old and already have over 500,000 users, over 3 million checkins and have our customer facing iPad installed in 3000 paying merchants.  We are the fastest growing technology startup in Chicago.



We also have a shit ton of fun.
