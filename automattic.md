##What is great about your company?

Want to make the web a better place for more than half a billion people each month? We’re hiring.

 

Everyone works from their own home or office, and we’re spread out all over the world — California, Texas, New York, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Iceland, Bulgaria, Australia, and more. We track about 70% of our projects on P2-themed WordPress.com blogs, 25% on private IRC channels, and the rest on Skype or AIM. Because of the geographic variance, we’re active pretty much 24/7. We care about the work you produce, not just the hours you put in.



When you make it past the interview stage we’ll do a project together on contract, typically lasting between 3-8 weeks, to see how we work together. When you join full-time, regardless of your position, you’ll do customer support for WordPress.com for your first three weeks. We believe this early connection with the people who use our products is irreplaceable.



We get the whole company together once a year to brainstorm the broad strategy for the company for the coming months, and also just to hang out and enjoy the company of the people we work with all day. So far we’ve done meetups in San Francisco; La Paz, Mexico; Oracle, Arizona; Breckenridge, Colorado; Mont-Sainte-Anne, Quebec; Seaside, Florida; Budapest, Hungary; and San Diego, California.
